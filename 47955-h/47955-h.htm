<p class="caption2"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></p>


<p>This little handbook aims at nothing more than an
account of the methods commonly employed in
the propagation and crossing of plants, and its
province does not extend, therefore, to the discussion of
any of the ultimate results or influences of these methods.
All such questions as those relating to the formation of
buds, the reciprocal influences of cion and stock, comparative
advantages of whole and piece roots, and the results
of pollination, do not belong here.</p>

<p>In its preparation I have consulted freely all the best
literature of the subject, and I have been aided by many
persons. The entire volume has been read by skilled
propagators, so that even all such directions as are commonly
recommended in other countries have also been
sanctioned, if admitted, as best for this. In the propagation
of trees and shrubs and other hardy ornamentals,
I have had the advice of the head propagator of one of
the largest nurseries in this country. The whole volume
has also passed through the hands of B. M. Watson, Jr.,
of the Bussey Institution of Harvard University, a
teacher of unusual skill and experience in this direction,
and who has added greatly to the value of the book.
The articles upon orchids and upon most of the different
genera of orchids in the Nursery List, have been contributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
by W. J. Bean, of the Royal Gardens, Kew,
who is well known as an orchid specialist. I have drawn
freely upon the files of magazines, both domestic and
foreign, and I have made particular use of Nicholson&rsquo;s Illustrated
Dictionary of Gardening, Vilmorin&rsquo;s Les Fleurs
de Pleine Terre, Le Bon Jardinier, and Rümpler&rsquo;s Illustriertes
Gartenbau-Lexikon.</p>

<p>It is believed that the Nursery List contains all the
plants which are ordinarily grown by horticulturists in
this country either for food or ornament. But in order
to give some clew to the propagation of any which are
omitted, an ordinal index has been added, by which one
can search out plants of a given natural order or
family. It cannot be hoped that the book is complete, or
that the directions are in every case best for all regions,
and any corrections or additions which will be useful in
the preparation of a second edition are solicited.</p>

<p class="caption2">SEEDAGE.</p>

<p><b>Seedage.</b>&mdash;The process or operation of propagating by seeds or spores,
or the state or condition of being propagated by seeds or spores.</p>


<p>There are three external requisites to the germination of
seeds&mdash;moisture, free oxygen, and a definite temperature.
These requisites are demanded in different degrees
and proportions by seeds of different species, or even by seeds
of the same species when differing widely in age or degree of
maturity. The supply of oxygen usually regulates itself. It is
only necessary that the seeds shall not be planted too deep, that
the soil is porous and not overloaded with water. Moisture
and temperature, however, must be carefully regulated.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 216px;">
<a name="fig_1" id="fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/fig_1.png" width="216" height="219" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 1. Double Seed-Pot.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Regulation of Moisture.</b>&mdash;Moisture is the most important
factor in seedage. It is usually applied to the seeds by means
of soil or some similar medium, as
moss or cocoanut fiber. Fresh and vigorous
seeds endure heavy waterings,
but old and poor seeds must be treated
sparingly. If there is reason to suspect
that the seeds are weak, water
should not be applied to them directly.
A favorite method of handling them is
to sow them in a pot of loose and sandy
loam which is set inside a larger pot,
the intermediate space being filled with
moss, to which, alone, the water is applied.
This device is illustrated in <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1</a>. The water soaks
through the walls of the inner pot and is supplied gradually and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
constantly to the soil. Even in this case it is necessary to prevent
soaking the moss too thoroughly, especially with very weak
seeds. When many pots are required, they may be simply
plunged in moss with the same effect. The soil should be
simply very slightly moist, never wet. Moisture is sometimes
supplied by setting the seed-pot in a shallow saucer of water, or
it may be sufficient to simply place it in the humid atmosphere of
a propagating-box. Large seeds may be laid upon the surface
of the soil in a half-filled pot, covered with thin muslin, and
then covered with loose and damp loam. Every day the pot
is inverted, the covering taken off and fresh soil is added. A
modification of this plan for small seeds can be made by placing
the seeds between two layers of thin muslin and inserting them
in damp loam, which is frequently renewed to avoid the extremes
which would result from watering or from allowing the
soil to become dry. In these last operations, no water is applied
to the seeds and they constitute one of the most satisfactory
methods of dealing with seeds of low vitality. They are essentially
the methods long ago used by Knight, who laid such seeds
between two sods cut from an old and dry pasture.</p>

<p>Even sound and strong seeds should be watered with care.
Drenchings usually weaken or destroy them. The earth should
be kept simply damp. To insure comparative dryness in in-door
culture, some loose material, as pieces of broken pots or
clinkers, should be placed in the bottom of the pot or box to
afford drainage. It should be borne in mind, however, that the
seed bed should be approximately equally moist throughout its
depth. The waterings should therefore be copious enough to
moisten the soil throughout. A wet or moist surface over a dry
substratum should always be avoided. Error is common
here. It is usually best to apply water with a watering-pot, as
watering with a hose is apt to wash out the seeds and to pack
the soil, and the quantity of water is not so easily regulated.</p>

<p>At first thought, it would appear that the apparently good
results following soaking of seeds in many cases, are a contradiction
of these statements that seeds may be over-watered. But
soaking is usually beneficial only when practiced for a comparatively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
short time. It is not good practice to soak delicate seeds
before sowing, and it is of doubtful utility in most other cases,
unless it is necessary to soften the integuments of hard-shelled
species, as discussed on <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>. The gain in rapidity of germination
following soaked, as compared with dry seeds, is really
fictitious, inasmuch as germination actually begins in the soaked
seeds before the dry samples are sown. The soaked seeds are
sown in water rather than in soil, and as conditions are more
uniform there, a gain apparently due to soaking may result. In
the case of strong seeds which must be planted out-doors in
cold or uncongenial soil, a preliminary soaking of from 12 to 24
hours may be beneficial, as it lessens the period which the seeds
would otherwise pass in untoward conditions. But soaked seeds,
unless of very hardy species, should never be sown out-doors
until the soil has become rather dry and warm.</p>

<p>To prevent too rapid drying out, the soil should be firmly
pressed about the seeds. The pot or box should be given
a shady place, or some covering may be applied to check
evaporation. A pane of glass is often placed over the box,
being tilted a little at intervals to allow of ventilation and
to prevent the soil from becoming soggy or &ldquo;sour.&rdquo; A seed-case,
with a glass cover, as shown in <a href="#fig_2">Fig. 2</a>,
is neat and handy in the treatment of small
seeds. A thin covering of fine moss is sometimes
given, or a newspaper may be thrown
over the soil.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 148px;">
<a name="fig_2" id="fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/fig_2.png" width="148" height="143" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 2. Seed-Case.</div>
</div>

<p>In out-door culture, only a naturally dry
and well-drained soil should be chosen for
all ordinary seeds, especially for such as are
sown in the fall or remain in the ground a
long time before germinating. Soils which contain a liberal
amount of sand or gravel are especially valuable for this
purpose.</p>

<p>To prevent drying in out-door culture, it is important that the
earth be well firmed over the seeds. Walking on the row, placing
one foot directly ahead of the other, is usually the most
expeditious and satisfactory operation, at least with large seeds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
Or the earth may be firmed with a hoe or the back of a spade,
or a board may be placed upon the row and then be thoroughly
settled by walking over it. In the sowing of celery and other
small and slow seeds, it is a frequent practice to leave the board
on the row until the seeds appear in order to hold the moisture.
This is a doubtful expedient, however, for the young plants are
apt to be quickly dispatched by the sun when the board is
removed. If the board is employed, it should be raised an inch
or two from the ground as soon as the plants begin to appear.
But the shade of the board is too dense and plants do not grow
stocky under it. It is better to use brush or lath screens if protection
is desired; or fine litter, if free from weed seeds, may be
used. In most cases, however, screens will not be needed by
celery and similar seeds if the ground is in the proper condition
and is well firmed at planting time. It is always advisable,
nevertheless, to place the beds for slow and small seeds where
they can be watered occasionally.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 360px;">

<img src="images/fig_3.png" width="360" height="273" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 3. Lath Screen.</div>
</div>

<p>There are many kinds of screens in use to prevent the drying
out of small seeds in out-door seedage and to protect the
young seedlings.
These are used also
in the shading of cuttings.
The common lath screen (<a href="#fig_3">Fig. 3</a>) is
the most useful for
general purposes. It
is simply a square
frame made from
common laths laid at
right angles in a
double series. The
interstices between
the laths are equal in width to the laths themselves. These
screens are laid horizontally upon a light frame-work a few
inches above the seeds. The passage of the sun constantly
moves the shadows over the bed, and sufficient shade is afforded
while thorough ventilation is allowed. This and all other elevated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
screens are useful in shading and protecting the young
plants as well, but when used for this purpose they are usually
raised a greater distance above the beds. A brush screen consisting
of a low frame covered with boughs, is often used, as
shown in <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. This is cheaper than the lath screens, and is
equally as good for most purposes. The brush is often laid
directly upon the ground, especially in large beds. This answers
the purpose of shading, but it does not allow of weeding and it
must be taken off soon after the seeds germinate, or slender
plants will be injured in its removal. Brush screens are sometimes
raised three or four feet to allow of weeding. A screen
for frames is shown in <a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. It is a simple covering of
muslin stretched over the top and sides of a rough frame-work.
The cloth is usually omitted from the front side. This style of
screens is much used by nurserymen, especially for cutting beds.
Whitewashing the sashes also affords good shading. A more
elaborate and permanent screen is shown in <a href="#fig_6">Fig. 6</a>. It is built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
of slats, usually 3-inch stuff. This shed screen is oftenest used
for the protection of tender plants, but it affords an exceedingly
useful and convenient place for the storage of pots and boxes of
slow-germinating seeds.</p>

<p>Various frames and covers are employed for in-door seedage,
but they are designed to regulate atmospheric moisture and to
control temperature. They are more commonly employed in
the growing of cuttings, and are therefore described in Chapter
IV.</p>

<p><b>Requirements of Temperature.</b>&mdash;Variations in temperature
exercise less influence upon seeds than variations in moisture.
Yet it is important that the extremes of temperature should not
be great, especially in small, delicate or weak seeds. Seeds will
endure greater extremes of temperature when dry than when
moist. This indicates that germinating seeds must be kept in a
comparatively uniform temperature. For this reason it is poor
practice to place seed-boxes in a window in full sunlight. Partial
or complete shade serves the double purpose of preventing too
great heat and too rapid evaporation. Various covered seed-boxes
are used for the purpose of maintaining approximately
the required temperature, but as they are oftener used in bud-propagation,
they are discussed in that connection.</p>

<p>Bottom heat is helpful to germination in most seeds, but, except
in the case of certain tropical species, it should not be strong.
It is a common practice to place the seed-boxes on moderately
cool pipes under benches in a greenhouse. Seeds of hardy
annuals and perennials do not require bottom heat, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
they may be benefitted by it. If the soil in seed beds should
become too cool, watering with warm or tepid water will be
found helpful.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give rules for the determination of the proper
temperature for different kinds of seeds. In general, it may be
said that seeds germinate most rapidly at a temperature a few
degrees above that required for the best development of the
plant itself. Hardy plants require a temperature of from 50&deg;
to 70&deg;, conservatory plants from 60&deg; to 75&deg; or 80&deg;, and tropical
or stove plants from 75&deg; to 95&deg;. The plantlets should be removed
from these highest temperatures, as a rule, as soon as
germination is completed.</p>

<p>In out-door culture, depth of planting has a direct relation to
temperature. Seeds may be planted deeper late in the season
than early, when the soil is cold and damp. Deep planting
probably as often kills seeds because of the absence of sufficient
heat as from the lack of oxygen or the great depth of
earth through which the plantlet is unable to push.</p>

<p><b>Preparatory Treatment of Seeds.</b>&mdash;Many seeds demand
some treatment preparatory to sowing. Nearly all hard and
bony seeds fail to germinate, or at least germinate very irregularly,
if their contents are allowed to become thoroughly dry
and hard. The shells must also be softened or broken in many
cases before the embryo can grow. Nature treats such seeds by
keeping them constantly moist under leaves or mold, and by
cracking them with frost. This suggests the practice known to
gardeners as <i>stratification</i>, an operation which consists in mixing
seeds with earth and exposing them to frost or to moisture for a
considerable time.</p>

<p>Stratification is practiced, as a rule, with all nuts, the seeds of
forest trees, shrubs, the pips of haws and often of roses, and
in many cases with the seeds of common fruits. It should be performed
as soon as possible after the seeds are mature. Small
seeds are usually placed in thin layers in a box alternating with an
inch or two of sand. Sometimes the seeds are mixed indiscriminately
in the sand, but unless they are large it is difficult to
separate them out at sowing time. The sand is often sown with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
the seeds, however, but it is difficult in such cases to distribute
the seeds evenly, and in sowing large quantities the handling of
the sand entails a considerable burden and becomes an item of
expense. It is advisable to pass the sand through a sieve of
finer mesh than the seeds, and the seeds can then be sifted
out at sowing time. If the seeds are very small or very few in
number they may be placed between folds of thin muslin, which
is then laid in the sand. Any shallow box, like a gardener&rsquo;s
&ldquo;flat,&rdquo; is useful in making stratifications, or with small lots of
seeds pots may be used. A flat four inches deep might contain
two or three layers or strata of seeds the size of peas.</p>

<p>The disposition of the boxes when filled varies with different
operators. Some prefer to bury them. In this case a well-drained
sandy slope is chosen. The flats are placed in a trench
from one to two feet deep, covered with a single thickness of
boards, and the trench is then filled with earth. The seeds
usually freeze somewhat, although freezing is not considered
necessary unless in the case of nut-like seeds. The object attained
in burying is to keep the seeds moist and fresh, inducing
the rotting or softening of the coverings, while they are buried
so deep that they will not sprout. Seeds of most forest trees
should be treated in this manner. They are commonly left in
the ground until the second spring, when they are taken up and
sown in drills in mellow ground. If good loam to which has
been added a little well-rotted manure is used, the seeds or nuts
of hardy trees and shrubs may be allowed to germinate and
grow for one season in the flats. At the end of the season or
the next spring the plants can be transplanted without losing
one. This is, perhaps, the best way to handle rare and difficult
subjects.</p>

<p>Many growers place the boxes on the surface in some protected
place, as under trees or in a shed, and cover them a foot
deep with clean straw or leaves. This is a good method for all
seeds which are to be sown the following spring, as those of
many fruits. If boxes are piled on top each other they should
be mulched with moss, else the under ones may become too dry.
Or the boxes may be placed without covering in a shed, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">« 17 »</a></span>
must be examined occasionally to see that they do not become
too dry. Precaution must also be taken to keep away mice,
squirrels, blue-jays and other intruders.</p>

<p>Large nut-like seeds or fruits, like peach-pits, walnuts and
hickory-nuts, are usually buried in sand or light loam where they
will freeze. Or sometimes the large nuts are thrown into a pile
with earth and allowed to remain on the surface. Freezing
serves a useful purpose in aiding to crack the shells, but it is not
essential to subsequent germination, as is commonly supposed.
All seeds, so far as known, can be grown without the agency of
frost if properly handled.</p>

<p>Fall sowing amounts to stratification, but unless the soil is mellow
and very thoroughly drained the practice is not advisable.
The seeds are liable to be heaved or washed out, eaten by vermin,
and the soil is apt to bake over them. Under proper conditions,
however, the seeds of fruits and many forest trees thrive well
under fall sowing. The seeds should be sown as soon as they
are ripe, even if in mid-summer; or if the ground is not ready
for them at that time, they may be temporarily stratified to prevent
too great hardening of the parts. It is best, however, to
allow all green or moist seeds to dry off a few days before they
are stratified. Fall sown seeds should always be mulched.</p>

<p>Some seeds rarely germinate until the second year after
maturity, even with the best of treatment. The thorns, mountain
ash, hollies, viburnums, some roses, and many others
belong to this category. Some growers sow them regularly as
soon as they are ripe and allow the beds to remain until the
seeds appear. This is a waste of land and of labor in weeding,
and the best way is to stratify them and allow them to remain
until the second spring before sowing.</p>

<p>Partial substitutes for stratification are soaking and scalding
the seeds. Soaking may be advantageously practiced in the case
of slow and hard seeds, which are not enclosed in bony shells,
and which have been allowed to become dry. Seeds of apple,
locust and others of similar character, are sometimes treated
in this manner. They are soaked for 24 or 36 hours, and it is
commonly supposed that if they are exposed to a sharp frost in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
the meantime, better results will follow. While still wet the
seeds are sown. Scalding water may be poured over locust
and other seeds to soften their covering. But
seeds should not be boiled, as sometimes
recommended.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 7. Bored Seed.</div>
</div>

<p>The germination of bony seeds is often
facilitated by filing or cutting away the shell
very carefully near the germ, or by boring
them. A bored nelumbium seed is shown in
<a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p>Treatment with various chemicals has been recommended for
the purpose of softening integuments, and also for some power
which strong oxidizing agents are supposed to exert in hastening
germination itself, but the advantages are mostly imaginary.
Secret and patented &ldquo;germinator&rdquo; compounds had better be
avoided.</p>

<p>Pulpy and fleshy coverings should be removed from seeds
before sowing. Soft fruits, like berries, are broken up or
ground into a pulp and the seeds are then washed out. This
separation may be performed immediately in some cases, but
when the pulp adheres to the seed, the whole mass is usually
allowed to stand until fermentation and partial decay has
liberated the seeds. The pulp will then rise, in most instances,
leaving the seeds at the bottom of the vessel. Seeds can be
liberated quickly by adding a stick of caustic potash to each pail
of water. After the mass has stood an hour or so, the seeds can
be rubbed out easily. Even tomato seeds can be cleaned with
safety in this manner. Seeds which have thin coverings, as the
viburnums and many haws, can be prepared by rubbing them
through the hands with sharp sand. Or the scant pulp of such
seeds may be allowed to rot off in the stratification box. Fleshy
coverings of hard and bony seeds may be removed by maceration.
Allow them to stand in water at a temperature of about
75&deg; for one to three weeks, and then wash them out. Resinous
coverings are sometimes removed by mixing the seeds with
fresh ashes or lime, or by treating them with lye. Hard, thick-walled
seeds are rarely injured by the decay of the pulpy covering,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
but thin-walled seeds should be cleaned, to avoid the possibility
of damaging them.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><b>Sowing.</b>&mdash;The soil in which seeds are sown, especially in in-door
culture, should be such as to allow of perfect drainage and
at the same time to hold moisture. Good potting soil, with a
liberal allowance of sharp sand, is the best for general purposes.
Pure sand becomes too dense, and leaf mold alone is usually too
loose and open. A proper combination of the two corrects both
faults. It is impossible to describe a good potting or seed-bed
soil. Some experience is essential to the best results in preparing
it. It should be of such character that when a damp portion
is firmly compressed in the hand it will fall apart when
released. It should never bake. Good old garden loam, to
which an equal quantity of sand has been added, is usually a
good soil for common in-door seedage. There should be no
manure in soil used for seeds which produce a delicate growth,
as rhododendrons and kalmias. In all such cases, rotted sod or
leafy peat forms the best basis. The soil should be sifted and
thoroughly fined before seeds are put into it. Seeds usually require
lighter soil than that in which the growing plant will flourish.
Cocoanut fiber is sometimes used in place of the soil, as it
holds moisture, allows of almost perfect drainage, and does not
become &ldquo;sour.&rdquo; Fine dead sphagnum moss may also be used.
Orchid seeds are usually sown on the live moss in which the
parent plant is growing; or they may be sown on damp wood or
cork. (See under <a href="#Orchids">Orchids</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chap. VI</a>.) Small seeds, like those
of cineraria and calceolaria, germinate well in very old cow-dung
obtained from a pasture; the unctuous matters have disappeared,
leaving a fibrous remainder. But all things considered,
well-prepared soil is the most satisfactory medium
which can be used. Seeds of aquatic plants which are to be
sown in a pond may be placed in a ball of clay and dropped
into the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span></p>

<p>Shallow boxes or &ldquo;flats&rdquo; and earthen seed-pans and lily-pans
are usually preferable to pots in which to grow seeds. They
give more surface in proportion to their contents and require
less attention in drainage. If pots are used, the four to
six inch sizes are best.</p>

<p>If delicate seeds are sown out-doors, they should be given
some protection, if possible. An ordinary hot-bed frame gives
the best results. In warm weather or a sunny exposure it will
be found desirable to substitute a cloth screen for the sash. A
thin or medium water-proof plant cloth, either commercial or
home-made, is excellent for this purpose. It may be tacked upon
a simple and light rectangular frame which is strengthened at
the corners by iron &ldquo;carriage-corners.&rdquo; These cloth-covered
frames are handy for many purposes, particularly for protecting
and supplying some warmth to seed-pans and young seedlings.</p>

<p>It is essential that good drainage be given all in-door seed-pots
or seed-beds. A layer of broken pots or other coarse
material is placed on the bottom. Many growers place a thin
layer of fine dead sphagnum moss or of peat over this drainage
material, and it certainly makes a useful addition. It is particularly
useful in isolated pots or small boxes, as it holds enough
moisture to prevent too rapid drying out, while all surplus water
is quickly taken off by the coarse material beneath. Over the
moss coarse siftings from the soil may be placed, while on top
only the finest and best soil should be used. The smaller the
seeds, the more care must be exercised in the sowing.</p>

<p>The proper depth for sowing varies directly with the size of
the seed. The chief advantage of very fine soil for small seeds
is the greater exactness of depth of covering which it allows.
Very small seeds should be sown upon the surface, which has
previously been well firmed and levelled, and then covered with
a very thin layer of finely sifted soil or a little old and dead
moss rubbed through a sieve. This covering should be scarcely
deeper than the thickness of the seeds; that is, the seeds should
be barely covered. Many prefer pressing the seeds into the soil
with a block. Or if one has a close propagating-box, the seeds
may remain upon the surface and sufficient moisture will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
supplied from the atmosphere. Such fine seeds are rarely
watered directly, as even the most careful treatment would be
likely to dislodge them. The soil is usually well watered before
the seeds are sown, or moisture may be supplied by inserting
the pot in water nearly to its rim for a few moments. If water
is applied from a hose, a thin cloth should first be spread on the
soil to hold it. Celery seeds, in out-door beds, are often sown
upon a nicely prepared surface and are then pressed in by means
of the feet or a board. Some cover to prevent evaporation
should be given all small seeds. This may be a board or a
slate slab at first, but as soon as the plants appear glass should
be substituted to admit light. (See pp. <a href="#Page_11">11</a> to <a href="#Page_14">14</a>.)</p>

<p>Large seeds demand much less care as to depth of covering,
as a rule. One-fourth or one-half inch is a good depth for most
coarse seeds in-doors. If one wishes to gauge the depth accurately,
the drills may be made by a planting stick, like that
shown in <a href="#fig_8">Fig. 8</a>. Its flange is made of the required thickness,
and it is pressed into the soil
until the cap strikes the surface.
This is a useful implement
in seed testing. Another
device for regulating the
depth of sowing, particularly
in seed testing, is the Tracy
planter, shown in <a href="#fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. It consists of two strips of heavy tin
plate about three inches wide, hung upon two wire pivots or
hinges some two inches long. At their upper edges and equidistant
from either end, the plates are joined by a firm spiral
spring, which serves to throw the upper edges apart, and to
cause the lower edges to join. This trough is now filled with
the required number of seeds, and is then inserted into the earth
to a given depth, when the fingers push inward on the spring
and the trough opens and delivers the seeds.</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous Matters.</b>&mdash;The influence which light exerts
upon germination is not definitely understood. It is known,
however, that seeds will often germinate in full sunlight, if the
proper conditions of moisture and temperature can be maintained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">« 22 »</a></span>
Seeds sown upon a moist surface and covered with a
glass present an interesting study. But it is well known, on the
other hand, that some seeds will not germinate, or will at least
appear unevenly, if subjected to sunlight. At least some of the
delphiniums, papavers and adonises germinate very imperfectly,
if at all, in direct light. It is always advisable to keep germinating
seeds in shade or partial darkness, especially as there is
nothing to be gained by exposing them. Of course the soil
itself is sufficient protection if the seeds are covered.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 541px;">
<a name="fig_9" id="fig_9"></a>
<img src="images/fig_9.png" width="541" height="132" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 9. Tracy Planter.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a common statement that seeds can never revive if
allowed to become thoroughly dry after they have begun to
sprout. This is an error. Wheat, oats, buckwheat, maize,
pea, onion, radish and other seeds have been experimented upon
in this direction, and they are found to re-germinate readily,
even if allowed to become thoroughly dry and brittle after
sprouting is well progressed. They will even re-germinate
several times. Wheat, peas and other seeds have been carried
through so many as seven germinations after the radicle had
grown a half inch or more and the seeds had been sufficiently
dried in each trial to render them fit for grinding.</p>

<p>Damping-off is a common ailment of young seedlings and
cuttings. The stem becomes brown and constricted at or near
the surface of the soil, and it soon rots and falls over. The top
of the plant often remains alive and fresh for several days after
it has fallen. A fungus is supposed to cause damping-off. The
conditions which seem to particularly favor the development of
this fungus are a moist and close atmosphere, crowding and
careless watering. Plants are particularly liable to damp-off if
only sufficient water is applied to keep the surface moist while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
the under soil remains dry. Hot sand, sifted over the plants,
will check it, but there is no complete remedy. Attention to
the above suggestions will serve as a preventive.</p>

<p>The transportation of certain kinds of seeds over long distances,
especially on sea voyages, is often beset with difficulties.
Thick-meated or soft seeds may become too dry if stored in a
warm place or too moist if stored in a cool one. The humid
atmosphere of the ocean is fatal to some seeds unless they are
well protected, and the moist and hot climates of some tropical
countries destroy many seeds of cooler regions before they can
be planted. Thin-coated seeds demand dryness and air, and
bony seeds usually need moisture and a more confined atmosphere.
Most seeds may be sent dry and loose in coarse paper
packages under all ordinary circumstances; but if they are to
traverse very hot and moist climates, they should be sealed in tin
cases or very securely wrapped in oiled paper, in which case
the seeds should be thoroughly dried before being packed.
Small seeds which are liable to become moldy may be packed
in finely powdered charcoal. Apple and pear seeds are often
imported in this manner. The seeds or fruits of woody plants
require more careful management. They should generally be
transported in some sort of stratification. A favorite method is
to place them in boxes or jars, mixed with naturally moist sand
or sawdust, or slightly moist dead sphagnum moss. Some prefer
to seal the packages hermetically, but under ordinary conditions
this is unnecessary. In transit, the packages should be stored in
a medium and uniform temperature. Even acorns, which are
often difficult to transport over long voyages, may be carried in
this manner with safety. It is important that the soil should not
be wet. Natural soil from a dryish and loamy pasture is excellent.
In some cases it is better to sprout the seeds in the native
country and ship the seedlings in a closed or Wardian case.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that actual plantings rarely give
so good results as seed tests, from the fact that conditions are
more variable. There is often a variation of over fifty per
cent. even when the planting has been carefully done. This is
proof that liberal seeding should always be practiced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span></p>

<p><b>Spores.</b>&mdash;Ferns, lycopodiums and selaginellas are often grown
from spores. The general conditions adapted to the germination
of seeds are also suitable for the germination of spores, but
extra care must be taken with the drainage. If a pot is used, it
should be half or more filled with drainage material, and the soil
should be rendered loose by the addition of bits of brick, charcoal,
cinders or other porous materials. The surface soil
should be fine and uniform. Some place a thin layer of brick
dust upon the surface, in which the spores are sown. It is a
frequent practice to bake the soil to destroy other spores
which might cause troublesome growths. The spores should be
sprinkled upon the surface and should not be covered. The pot
should be set in a saucer of water and it should be covered by
paper or a pane of glass if the sun strikes it. Better results are
obtained if the pot or pan is placed inside a propagating-frame or
under a bell-glass. In place of earth, a block or small cubes
of firm peat or sandstone may be employed. The block is
placed in a saucer of water and the spores are sown upon its surface.
Water should not be applied directly to the spores, as it is
apt to dislodge them.</p>

<p>The period of germination varies in different species, but
three to six weeks may be considered the ordinary limits. While
still very small, the plantlets should be pricked out, and for
some time thereafter they should be subjected to the same conditions
as before. Spores are so exceedingly small and light
that the greatest care must be exercised in growing them. In
order to gather them, the fronds may be cut as soon as the sori
or fruit-dots turn brown, and stored in close boxes or paper bags.</p>

<p class="caption2">SEPARATION.</p>

<p><b>Separation.</b>&mdash;The act or process of multiplying plants by means of
naturally detached asexual organs, or the state or condition of being so
multiplied.</p>


<p>Separation is effected by means of bulbs, bulbels,
bulb-scales, bulblets, corms, tubers, offsets, crowns and
sometimes by buds.</p>

<p>Bulbs of all kinds are specialized buds. They are made up
of a short and rudimentary axis closely encased in transformed
and thickened leaves or bulb-scales. These thickened parts are
stored with nutriment which is used during subsequent growth.
Bulbs occur only in plants which are accustomed to a long
period of inactivity. Many bulbous plants are peculiar to dry
and arid regions, where growth is impossible
during long periods. A bulb
is, therefore, a more or less permanent
and compact leaf-bud, usually occupying
the base of the stem underground
and emitting roots from its lower portion.
Bulbs are conveniently divided
into two great classes&mdash;the scaly, or
those composed of narrow and mostly
loose scales, as in the lily, and laminate
or tunicate, or those composed of
more or less continuous and close-fitting
layers or plates, as in the onion.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 218px;">

<img src="images/fig_10.png" width="218" height="291" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 10. Bulb of Lilium
candidum.</div>
</div>

<p>Bulbs often break up or divide
themselves into two or more nearly equal portions, as in <i>Lilium
candidum</i>, shown one-third natural size in <a href="#fig_10">Fig. 10</a>. The parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
may be separated and treated as complete bulbs for purposes of
propagation. This division or separation of bulbs proceeds in a
different manner in nearly every species, yet it is so obvious that
the novice need not be perplexed by it. Almost any breaking
apart of these loose bulbs, if only a &ldquo;heart&rdquo; or central axis
remains in each portion, is successful for purposes of slow multiplication;
but when flowers are desired it is usually inadvisable.</p>

<p>Bulbous plants multiply most easily by means of <i>bulbels</i>&mdash;often
also called bulbules and offsets&mdash;or small bulbs which are
borne about a large or mother bulb. In some lilies, as <i>Lilium
candidum</i>, the bulbels form at the top or crown of the mother
bulb, and a circle of roots will be found between them and the
bulb; in others, as <i>L. speciosum</i> and <i>L. auratum</i>, they form on
the lower part of the flower stalk. In some species the
bulbels are few and very large, or even single, and they bloom
the following year. In such cases the bulb undergoes a progressive
movement from year to year after the manner of root-stocks,
the bulb of one year forming a more or less distinct
one above and beyond it which continues the species, while the
old one becomes weak or dies. This method of bulb formation
is seen in the cut of <i>Lilium pardalinum</i>, <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. In the hyacinth
the bulbels form at the base of the bulb.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 222px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 11. Bulb of Lilium pardalinum.</div>
</div>

<p>Bulbels vary greatly in size and
frequency in different species. Sometimes
they are no larger than a grain
of wheat, and in other plants they
are as large as hickory-nuts. In some
species they are borne habitually underneath
the scales of the mother
bulb. These bulbels are often removed
when the mother bulbs are
taken up, and they are usually planted
in essentially the same manner as the
bulbs themselves, although it is desirable
to place them, at least for the first year, in a bed or
border by themselves. Or if they are especially small and delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span>
they may be planted in pots or flats and be treated about
the same as single eye cuttings. In some lilies the bulbels are
allowed to remain attached and the whole
mass is planted in the fall in close drills.
Sometimes the larger lily bulbels will
produce flowers the following season, but
they usually require the whole of the
season in which to complete their growth.
The second fall they are ready to be permanently
planted. Bulbels of some
plants require a longer time in which
to mature into bulbs.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 13. Hollowed Hyacinth
Bulb.</div>
</div>

<p>Bulbels are often produced by an injury
to the bulb. Growth of stem and
leaves is prevented or checked and the energy is directed to
the formation of minute buds, or bulbs, in the same manner
as adventitious buds form upon a wounded stem. Advantage
is taken of this fact to multiply some bulbous plants, and in
the case of the hyacinths, at least, the mutilation of bulbs for
this purpose is practiced to a commercial extent. Hyacinth
bulbs are cut in two, or are slashed in various ways. The favorite
method is to make two or three deep transverse cuts into the
base of the bulb. The strongest bulbs should be chosen and
the operation is performed in spring or
early summer when the bulb is taken
up. The bulbs are sometimes hollowed
out from the under side for
half or more of their length. This
operation is sometimes performed
later in the season than the other, and
precaution should be exercised that
the bulbs do not become too moist, else
they will rot. Hollowed bulbs should
be well dried before being planted.
Both methods of preparing hyacinth
bulbs are shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_12">12</a> and <a href="#fig_13">13</a> which are adapted from
Gardeners' Chronicle. <a href="#fig_14">Fig. 14</a> shows a portion of the base of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">« 28 »</a></span>
a cross-cut bulb, with the adventitious bulbels. The mutilated
bulbs are stored during summer, and are
planted in fall or spring. The wounded
bulbs produce very little foliage, but at the
end of the first season the bulbels will have
formed. The bulbels are then separated and
planted by themselves in prepared beds.
Several years are required for the bulbels to
mature into flowering bulbs. Some of the
strongest ones may produce flowering bulbs
in three years, but some of them, especially
those obtained from the hollowed bulbs, will
not mature short of six years. This method
of propagating hyacinths is confined almost
entirely to Holland.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 14. Cross-Cut
Bulb.</div>
</div>

<p>The scales of bulbs are often employed to multiply scarce
varieties. From ten to thirty of the thicker scales may be
removed from the outside of the bulb without serious injury to
it. These are treated in the same manner as single eye cuttings.
They are usually handled in flats or propagating-frames,
and are pressed perpendicularly into a light and
loose soil&mdash;half sharp sand and half leaf-mould&mdash;for nearly
or quite their entire length, or are scattered in damp moss.
Keep the soil simply moist, and for hardy and half-hardy
species keep the temperature rather low&mdash;from
45&deg; to 60&deg;. Slight bottom heat may sometimes
be given to advantage. In from three to
ten weeks a little bulbel, or sometimes two or
more, will appear at the base of the scale, as shown
in <a href="#fig_15">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 93px;">

<img src="images/fig_15.png" width="93" height="198" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 15. Bulb-Scale.</div>
</div>

<p>These pots or flats may be plunged out-doors during
summer if the planting was done in winter, or
the scales may be potted off or transferred to the
open border as soon as rootlets have formed. It is
the common practice with most hardy species to
allow the scales to remain in the original flats during summer and
to cover them the next fall, allowing them to remain out-doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
over winter. The succeeding spring they are shifted into a bed
or border, and by the next fall&mdash;having had two summers' growth&mdash;most
species will be ready for permanent planting in the flower
border.</p>

<p>A <i>bulblet</i> is a small bulb borne entirely above ground, usually
in the axil of a leaf or in the inflorescence. Familiar examples
occur in the tiger lily and in &ldquo;top&rdquo; onions. In the former instance
the bulblets are direct transformations of buds, while
in the onion they are transformed flowers. It is impossible to
draw any line of separation between bulblets and buds. In
some plants, certain buds detach themselves and fall to the
ground to multiply the species. Sometimes these buds vegetate
before they fall from the plants, as in the case of various ferns.
For purposes of propagation, bulblets are treated in the same
way as bulbels, and like them, they reproduce the variety upon
which they grow. They
will develop into full
grown bulbs in from one
to three years, according
to the species.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 16. Gladiolus Corm.</div>
</div>

<p>A <i>corm</i> is a bulb-like
organ which is solid
throughout. Familiar
examples occur in the
gladiolus and crocus.
Cormous plants are multiplied
in essentially the
same manner as bulbous
species. As a rule, a new
corm is produced each
year above the old one,
and this commonly bears
flowers the following season.
This renewal is
well shown in the gladiolus,
<a href="#fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. The illustration shows a gladiolus bottom, half
size, when taken up in November. At the base are seen the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
withered remains of the corm which was planted in the spring,
and above it the new corm which will furnish bloom the following
season. A number of <i>cormels</i> or &ldquo;spawn&rdquo; have also appeared.
These may be planted out in a border or bed and will
produce mature bulbs in one or two seasons. The larger ones,
under good treatment, will often produce bulbs an inch in
diameter the first season. Some growers keep the cormels a
year and a half before planting them out, as they are thought to
vegetate more evenly under such treatment; in this case they
should be placed in sand to prevent too great drying out.</p>

<p>Adventitious cormels may be produced by various methods of
wounding the mother corm, and this practice of exciting them
is often necessary, as some varieties do not produce cormels
freely. Each bud on the top or side of the corm may be made
to produce a separate corm by cutting a deep ring around it, so
as to partly divide it. Or the corm may be directly cut into as
many separate pieces as there are buds or eyes, after the manner
of cutting potatoes, but these pieces are usually handled in
flats where temperature and moisture can be controlled. Almost
any injury to such vigorous corms as those of the gladiolus and
crocus will result in the production of cormels, if care is taken
that the corms do not become so cold and wet that they will rot.</p>

<p>A <i>tuber</i> is a prominently thickened portion of a root or stem,
and it is usually subterranean. The potato, sweet potato and
dahlia furnish good examples. Tuberiferous plants are multiplied
by planting these tubers whole, or the tubers may be
cut into small portions as described in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>, in the descriptions
of cuttings. In hardy species, the tubers may be allowed
to remain in the ground during winter, but they are generally
dug in the fall and stored in a dry and cold place, but where
they will not freeze.</p>

<p>An <i>offset</i> is a crown or rosette of leaves, usually borne next
the surface of the ground, which detaches itself and forms an
independent plant. The best examples occur in the house-leeks,
plants which are more familiarly known as &ldquo;hen and chickens&rdquo;
and &ldquo;man and wife.&rdquo; These offsets take root readily, and in
propagating there is no other care necessary than to remove
and plant them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span></p>

<p>A <i>crown</i> is a detachable portion of a root-stock bearing roots
and a prominent bud. Rhizomes or root-stocks multiply individuals
and extend the distribution of the species by means of a
progressive movement of the crowns. The root-stock grows
during summer, and at the end of the season each branch
develops a strong terminal bud which usually produces a flowering
stem the following season. The root-stock gradually dies
away at its old extremity, and in a few years a single individual
gives rise to a considerable patch. This is well shown by the
common May-Apple or podophyllum.</p>

<p class="caption2">LAYERAGE.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Layerage.</b>&mdash;The operation or practice of making a layer, or the state
or condition of being layered.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Layer.</b>&mdash;A shoot or root, attached to the parent plant, partially or
wholly covered with earth with the intention that it shall take root and then
be severed from the parent.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Stolon.</b>&mdash;A decumbent shoot which, without the aid of man, takes root
and forms an independent plant.</p>


<p>Many plants habitually propagate by means of decumbent
shoots and runners. These shoots become more
or less covered with earth or leaves, and roots are emitted,
usually at the joints. In many cases, the old shoots die away
and an entirely independent plant arises from each mass of roots.
In other plants, the shoots remain attached to the parent, at least
for a number of years, so that the plant comprises a colony of
essentially distinct individuals. Great numbers of plants which
do not propagate naturally by means of layers are readily increased
by this means under the direction of the grower. In
most cases it is only necessary to lay down the branches, cover
them with earth, and allow them to remain until roots are well
formed, when they can be severed from the parent. Layering is
one of the simplest methods of propagation, as the mother
plants nurse the layer plants until they can sustain themselves.
It is a ready means of multiplying hard-wooded plants which
do not grow well from cuttings.</p>

<p>All vines, and all plants which have runners or long and slender
shoots which fall to the ground, may be multiplied readily by
layerage. Among fruits, the black-cap raspberry is a familiar
example. The canes of the current year bend over late in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
summer and the tips strike the earth. If the tip is secured by
a slight covering of earth, or if it finds lodgment in a mellow
soil, roots are emitted and in
the fall a strong bud or
&ldquo;crown&rdquo; or &ldquo;eye&rdquo; is formed
for next year&rsquo;s growth. The
parent cane is severed in the
fall or spring, some four or
six inches above the ground,
and an independent plant,
known as a &ldquo;root-tip,&rdquo; as
shown in <a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>, is obtained.
In this instance, as in most
others, it is immaterial at
what point the parent stem is severed, except that a short portion
of it serves as a handle in carrying the plant, and also marks
the position of the plant when it is set. The black raspberry
propagates itself naturally by means of layers, and it is only
necessary, in most cases, to bring the soil into a mellow condition
when the tips begin to touch the ground in order that they
may find anchorage. This layering by inserting the growing
point has the advantage of producing very strong &ldquo;crowns&rdquo; or
plants in autumn from shoots or canes of the same year, and it
should be more generally practised. Even currants, gooseberries,
and many other plants can be handled in this way.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 296px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 19. Covered Layer of Viburnum.</div>
</div>

<p>In most cases of layerage it is necessary to lay down the branches
and to cover them. The covering may be continuous, as in <a href="#fig_19">Fig. 19</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
or it may be applied only to the joints or restricted portions of
the shoot, as illustrated in <a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>. In either case, the covering
should be shallow, not exceeding one to three inches. If the
shoot is stiff a stone or sod may be placed upon it to hold it
down; or a crotched stick may be thrust down over it, as in the
&ldquo;pegging down&rdquo; of propagators.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 531px;">

<img src="images/fig_20.png" width="531" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 20. Layered Shoots.</div>
</div>

<p>The strongest plants are usually obtained by securing only one
plant from a shoot, and for this purpose the earth should be
applied only at one point, preferably over a bud somewhere
near the middle of the shoot. If the buds are close together, all
but the strongest one may be cut out. If more plants are
desired, however, <i>serpentine layering</i> may be practiced, as shown
at A in <a href="#fig_20">Fig. 20</a>. The shoot is bent in an undulating fashion,
and from every covered portion roots will form and a plant may
be obtained. The covered layer also possesses the advantage of
giving more than one plant, but the roots are apt to form so continuously
that definite and strong plants are rarely obtained;
these rooted portions may be treated as cuttings, however, with
good results. The grape is sometimes propagated by serpentine
layering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span></p>

<p>Stiff and hard-wooded plants do not often &ldquo;strike&rdquo; or root
readily, and in order to facilitate rooting the branch is wounded
at the point where a new plant is desired. This wounding
serves to induce formation of adventitious buds at that point,
and to check the growth of the branch at the tip. It is a common
practice to cut the branch about half in two obliquely, on
the lower side. This operation is known as &ldquo;tongueing.&rdquo;
"Ringing" or girdling, twisting, notching, and various other
methods are employed, none of which, perhaps, possess any
peculiar advantages in general practice. Some propagators cut
all the buds from the covered portion. In this case the free and
protruding end of the layer is expected to form the top of the
new plant. &ldquo;Arching,&rdquo; or very abrupt bending, as in serpentine
layering, serves the same purpose and is the only attention
necessary in most vines.</p>

<p>When large numbers of plants are desired, as in commercial
nurseries, it is often necessary to cut back the parent plant to
the ground, or very nearly so, for the purpose of securing many
shoots fit for layering. A plant which is cut back in the spring
will produce shoots fit for layering the following spring; or
some species will produce them in abundance the same year if
layers of green or immature wood are desired. These parent or
stock-plants are called &ldquo;stools&rdquo; by nurserymen.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 298px;">

<img src="images/fig_21.png" width="298" height="206" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 21. Mound Layering of Gooseberry.</div>
</div>

<p>In many species layerage is performed to best advantage by
heaping earth over the stool
and around the shoots. This
is known as <i>mound</i> or <i>stool
layering</i>. The shoots send
out roots near the base and
straight, stocky plants are
obtained. The English
gooseberries are almost exclusively
propagated in this
manner in this country. <a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>
shows a row of mound-layered
gooseberries. The shoots are allowed to remain in layerage
two years, in the case of English gooseberries, if the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
plants are wanted, but in many species the operation is completed
in a single season. Quinces and Paradise apple stocks
are extensively mound-layered. The practice is most useful in
those low plants which produce short and rather stiff shoots.</p>

<p>As a rule, the best season for making layers is in spring when
the leaves are forming. Rooting progresses rapidly at that
season. Many plants &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; if layered earlier in the season.
Hardy shrubs may be layered in the fall, either early or late, and
if an incision is made, a callus will have formed by spring. If
rapid multiplication is desired, the soft and growing shoots may
be layered during the summer. This operation is variously
known as &ldquo;summer,&rdquo; "herbaceous," &ldquo;green&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; layering.
Comparatively feeble plants usually result from this
practice, and it is not in common favor.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 365px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 22. Pot layerage.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Pot layering</i>, <i>circumposition</i>, <i>air layering</i> and <i>Chinese layering</i>
are terms applied to the rooting of rigid stems by means of surrounding
them, while in their natural position, by earth or
moss, or similar material.
The stem is
wounded&mdash;commonly girdled&mdash;and a divided
pot or box is placed
about it and filled with
earth (<a href="#fig_22">Fig. 22</a>). The
roots start from above
the girdle, and when
they have filled the
pot the stem is severed,
headed back, and
planted. Pot layering
is practiced almost exclusively
in greenhouses,
where it is
possible to keep the
earth uniformly moist.
But even there it is advisable to wrap the pot in moss to check
evaporation from the soil. Some plants can be readily rooted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
wrapping them with moss alone. Pot layering is employed not
only for the purpose of multiplying plants, but in order to lower
the heads of &ldquo;leggy&rdquo; or
scraggly specimens.
The pot is inserted at
the required point upon
the main stem, and after
roots have formed abundantly
the top may be
cut off and potted independently, the old
stump being discarded.</p>

<p>The French have various handy devices for facilitating pot
layering. <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a> shows a layering pot, provided with a niche
in the side to receive
the stem, and a
flange behind for
securing if to a support.
<a href="#fig_24">Fig. 24</a> represents
a layering
cone. It is made of
zinc or other metal,
usually four or five
inches high, and is composed of two semi-circular wings which
are hinged on the back and are secured in front, when the
instrument is closed, by means of a
hinge-pin. A cord is inserted in one
side with which to hang it on a support.
A cup or pot with a removable
side is also used. This is shown
open in <a href="#fig_25">Fig. 25</a> and closed in <a href="#fig_26">Fig. 26</a>.
An ingenious compound layering
pot is shown in <a href="#fig_27">Fig. 27</a>. The
main stem or trunk of the plant is
carried through the large opening,
and the branches are taken through
the smaller pots at the side. Kier&rsquo;s layering boxes or racks are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_28">28</a> and <a href="#fig_29">29</a>. The trays are filled with earth and
the branches are laid in through the
chinks in the border and are treated in
the same manner as ordinary out-door
layers. These racks supply a neat and
convenient means of increasing greenhouse
plants which do not readily strike
from cuttings.</p>

<p>It is well to bear in mind that when
layers do not give strong plants, they can
be divided into portions and treated as
ordinary cuttings. This is an important
operation in the case of rare varieties
which are multiplied by means of soft or
green layers, as some of the large-flowered
clematises and grapes. The weak small plants are handled
in a cool greenhouse or under frames, usually in pots, and they
soon make strong individuals.</p>

<p><b>Devices for Regulating Moisture and Heat.</b>&mdash;In order to
secure a uniform and moist atmosphere, various propagating-frames
are devised. Whatever its construction, the frame should
be sufficiently tight to confine the air closely, it should admit
light, and allow of ventilation. The simplest form of propagating-frame
is a pot or box covered with a pane of glass. To
admit of ventilation the glass is tilted at intervals, or two panes
may be used and a space be allowed to remain between them.
A common bell-glass
or bell-jar (<i>cloche</i> of
the French) makes one
of the best and handiest
propagating-frames
because it admits light
upon all sides and is
convenient to handle.
These are in universal
use for all difficult and
rare subjects which
are not propagated in large numbers. A hand-glass or hand-light
(<a href="#fig_30">Fig. 30</a>) answers the same purpose and accommodates a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span>
larger number of plants. A useful propagating-box for the
window garden or amateur conservatory is shown in <a href="#fig_31">Fig. 31</a>.
A box two or three inches high is
secured, and inside this a zinc or
galvanized iron tray, <i>a</i>, is set, leaving
sufficient space between it and
the box to admit a pane of glass
upon every side. These panes form
the four sides of the box, and one or
two panes are laid across the top.
The metal tray holds the soil and
allows no water to drip upon the
floor. One of the best boxes for
general purposes is made in the form
of a simple board box without top or
bottom, and fifteen or eighteen inches high, the top being covered
with two sashes, one of which raises upon a hinge (<a href="#fig_32">Fig. 32</a>).
Four by three feet is a convenient size. An ordinary light hot-bed
frame is sometimes constructed upon the bench of a greenhouse
and covered with common hot-bed sash. Propagating houses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
are sometimes built with permanent propagating-frames of this
character throughout their length.</p>

<p>In all the
above appliances
heat is
obtained from
the sun or from
the bench-pipes
or flues of a
greenhouse.
There are various
contrivances
in which
the heat is applied
locally,
for the purpose
of securing
greater or more uniform heat. One of the simplest and best
of these is the propagating-oven shown in <a href="#fig_33">Fig. 33</a>. It is a glass
covered box about two feet deep, with a tray of water beneath
the soil, and which is heated by a lamp. A similar but somewhat
complicated apparatus is illustrated in Figs. <a href="#fig_34">34</a>, <a href="#fig_35">35</a>, <a href="#fig_36">36</a>.
This is an old form of oven, which has been variously modified
by different operators. <a href="#fig_34">Fig. 34</a> shows a sectional view
of the complete apparatus.
The box, A A, is made of
wood and is usually about
three feet square. L is a
removable glass top. B
represents a zinc or galvanized
iron tray which is
filled with earth in which
seeds are sown or pots are
plunged. C is a water tray
to which the water is applied
by means of a funnel extending through the box. A lamp, D,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span>
supplies the heat. A funnel of tin, <i>e e</i>, distributes the heat evenly.
Holes should be provided about the bottom of the box to admit
air to the flame. A modified
form of this device is
shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_35">35</a> and <a href="#fig_36">36</a>.
The water tray, G, slides in
upon ledges so that it can
be removed, and the heat
funnel, L D L, slides in
similarly and is made to
surround the flame like a
chimney. The front side
of the apparatus is removable, and the top of the frame, K, is
made of metal. The cover for this apparatus is figured in
<a href="#fig_36">Fig. 36</a>. The ends, <i>a a</i>, are made of wood, with openings, indicated
by the arrows, to allow of ventilation. The front and
top, <i>g g</i>, are made of glass. The frame-work, <i>c c c</i>, is made of
metal. The cover is hinged on, or held with pegs, I I, <a href="#fig_35">Fig. 35</a>.</p>

<p>Chauvière&rsquo;s propagating-frame, an apparatus used by the
French, is shown in <a href="#fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. It is essentially a miniature greenhouse.
The sashes are seen at <i>c c</i>, and above them is a cloth or
matting screen. The sides below the sashes are enclosed, preferably
with glass. The bottom or floor is moveable, and it is
sometimes divided into two or three sections to allow for the accommodation
of plants of different sizes and requirements.
These sections are raised or lowered and are held by pegs. At a
is shown a section of floor elevated, and at the left another section
occupying
a lower
position.
Heat is supplied
usually
by hot water
in the tubes,
<i>d d</i>. A very
elaborate circular French device, known as Lecoq&rsquo;s propagating-oven,
is illustrated in <a href="#fig_38">Fig. 38</a>. It is an interesting apparatus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span>
and is worth attention as showing the care which has been taken
to control the conditions of vegetation and germination. It is
too elaborate for common purposes, and yet for the growing of
certain rare or difficult subjects it might find favor among those
who like to experiment; and it affords an accurate means of
studying plant growth under control. The apparatus is sold in
France for about $6. All the portion below the glass top, <i>P p</i>,
is made of earthenware. The base, <i>a a</i>, holds a lamp, <i>d</i>; <i>e</i> is a
water reservoir to which water is supplied by means of the
funnel, <i>j</i>. A vase or rim, <i>b b</i>, rests upon the base, and upon it a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
plate or disc, <i>c c</i>, is fitted. Above this is a glass top, <i>P p</i>. Air is
admitted to the apparatus at <i>i</i>, <i>K K</i>, and between the vase and
plate, as at <i>c</i> on the right. The plate contains two circular
grooves, <i>g g</i> and <i>h h</i>. In these grooves the soil is placed or pots
plunged. The heat circulates in the valleys <i>m</i> and <i>n n n n</i>, and
supplies a uniform temperature to both sides of the plants.</p>

</div>

<p>Barnard&rsquo;s propagating-tank, <a href="#fig_39">Fig. 39</a>, is a practicable device for
attachment to a common stove. A similar apparatus may be
attached to the pipes of a greenhouse. The tank consists of a
long wooden box made of
matched boards, and put together
with paint between the
joints to make the box water-tight.
The box should be about
three feet wide and ten inches
deep, and may be from ten to
thirty feet long, according to
the space required. In the
middle of the box is a partition,
extending nearly the
whole length of the box, and on the inside, on each side, is a
ledge or piece of moulding to support slates to be laid over the
entire surface of the box. The slates are supported by the
ledges and by the central partition, and should be fastened down
with cement to prevent the propagating sand from falling into
the tank. One slate is left out near the end, next the fire, to
enable the operator to see the water and to keep it at the right
level. On the slates sand is spread, in which the cuttings may
be struck, the sand nearly filling the box. At one end of the
box is placed a common cylinder stove, with pipe to the chimney.
Inside the stove is a lead or iron pipe (iron is the best)
bent in a spiral. This coil, which is directly in the fire, is connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
by iron pipes with the tank, one pipe leading to one side
of the partition and the other to the opposite side, as shown in
the drawing.
If water is
placed in the
tank it will fill
the pipes and
form a continuous
circulating
system
through the
pipes and up
one side of the
box past the
end of the
partition, and
down the
other side. A fire in the stove causes the water to circulate
through the tank and impart to the bed a genial warmth.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 40. Zinc Propagating-tank.</div>
</div>

<p>There are various tanks designed to rest upon the pipes in a
greenhouse. The principle of their construction is essentially
the same as of those described in previous pages&mdash;bottom heat,
a tray of water, and a bed of soil. Earthenware tanks are
commonly employed, but a recent English device, <a href="#fig_40">Fig. 40</a>, is
made of zinc. It is about seven inches deep, and holds an inch
or two of water in the bottom. A tray five inches deep sets into
the tank. The water is supplied through a funnel at the base.</p>

<p>Cuttings usually &ldquo;strike&rdquo; better when they touch the side of
the pot than when they are wholly surrounded by soil. This is
because the earthenware allows greater uniformity in moisture
than the earth, and supplies air and a mild bottom heat. Various
devices are employed for the purpose of securing these
advantages to the best effect. These are usually double pots, in
one of which water is placed. A good method is that represented
in <a href="#fig_41">Fig. 41</a>, which shows a pot, <i>b</i>, plugged with plaster of
Paris at the bottom, placed inside a larger one. The earth is
placed between the two, drainage material occupying the bottom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
<i>a</i>, and fine soil the top, <i>c</i>. Water stands in the inner pot
as high as the dotted line and feeds uniformly into the surrounding
soil. The positions of the water and
soil are frequently reversed, but in that
case there is less space available for cuttings.
Neumann&rsquo;s cutting-pot is shown in
<a href="#fig_42">Fig. 42</a>. This contains an inverted pot in
the center, <i>a</i>, designed to supply drainage
and to admit heat into the center of the
mass of soil.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 213px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 41. Forsyth&rsquo;s Cutting-pot.</div>
</div>

<p>Some kind of protection, commonly
combined with bottom heat, is always given
cuttings made from the soft and growing
parts. In in-door work, any of the devices named above may
be employed, but a box like that shown in <a href="#fig_32">Fig. 32</a> is one of
the most useful for common operations. Or the greenhouse
itself may afford sufficient protection, especially if the cuttings
are shaded when first set to check evaporation from the plant
and soil, and to prevent too great heat. This shading is usually
supplied by whitewashing the glass, or a newspaper may be laid
over the cutting bed for a few days. A greenhouse table or
bench prepared for the growing of cuttings is known as a &ldquo;cutting
bench.&rdquo; If the cuttings become too dry or too hot, they
will wilt or &ldquo;flag.&rdquo; In out-door work soft cuttings are usually
placed in an ordinary cold-frame, and these frames must be
shaded. They may be placed under trees or on the shady side
of a building, or if they are numerous,
as in commercial establishments, a cloth
screen should be provided as shown in
<a href="#fig_5">Fig. 5</a>, <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 42. Neumann&rsquo;s Cutting-pot.</div>
</div>

<p><b>Soils and General Methods.</b>&mdash;Soil for
all cuttings should be well-drained. It
should not be so compact as to hold a
great quantity of water, nor should it be
so loose as to dry out very quickly. It
should not &ldquo;bake&rdquo; or form a crust on its surface. As a rule,
especially for cuttings made of growing parts, the soil should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
not contain vegetable matter, as such material holds too much
water and it is often directly injurious to the cutting. A coarse
sharp, clean sand is the best material for use in-doors. Very
fine sand packs too hard, and should not be used. Some propagators
prefer to use fine gravel, composed of particles from an
eighth to a fourth of an inch in diameter, and from which all
fine material has been washed. This answers well for green
cuttings if a propagating-frame is used to check evaporation and
attention is given to watering, because drainage is so perfect and
the material so quickly permeable that uniformity of treatment
is secured. Damping-off is less liable to occur in such material
than in denser soils. The same advantages are to some extent
present in sphagnum moss and cocoanut fibre, both of which
are sometimes used in place of earth. The &ldquo;silver sand&rdquo; used
by florists is a very clean and white sand which derives its particular
advantages from the almost entire absence of any vegetable
matter. But it is not now considered so essential to successful
propagation as it was formerly, and fully as good
material may often be found in a common sand-bank. Cuttings
which strike strongly and vigorously may be placed in a
soil made of light garden loam with twice its bulk of sand added
to it. All soils used for in-door cuttage should be sifted or
screened before using to bring them to a uniform texture.</p>

<p>Hard-wood cuttings are commonly planted out-doors in mellow
and light loam, well trenched. Only fine and well-rotted
manure should be applied to the cutting bed, and it should be
well mixed with the soil. In most cases, a well-drained soil
gives best results, but some cuttings root and grow well in wet
soils or even in standing water, as poplars, willows, some of the
dogwoods, plane-tree and others.</p>

<p>Bottom heat is always essential to the best success with cuttings.
In out-door work this is supplied by the natural heat of
the soil in spring and summer, and it is often intensified by
burying hard-wooded cuttings bottom end up for a time before
planting them. This operation of inverting cuttings is often
practiced with grapes, particularly with the Delaware and
others which root with some difficulty. The cuttings are tied in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
bundles and are buried in a sandy place, with the tops down,
the butts being covered two or three inches with sand. They
may be put in this position in the fall and allowed to remain
until the ground begins to freeze hard, or they may be buried
in spring and allowed to remain until May or June and then be
regularly planted. In out-door cuttage, the cuttings which are
of medium length, from six to eight inches, derive
more bottom heat than the very long ones, such as
were formerly used for the propagation of the grape.
In in-door work bottom heat is obtained artificially.
Cutting benches should have abundant piping beneath,
and in the case of many tropical and sub-tropical
species the bottom heat may be intensified by enclosing
the benches below so that no heat can escape into
the house. Doors can be placed in the partition alongside
the walk to serve as ventilators if the heat should
become too intense. In all cuttings, bottom or root
growth should precede top growth, and this is aided by
bottom heat.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 43. Grape cutting.</div>
</div>

<p>As a rule, roots arise most readily from a joint,
and it is therefore a common practice to cut off the
base of the cutting just below a bud, as shown in the
grape cutting, <a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>. Sometimes the cutting is
severed at its point of attachment to the parent
branch, and a small portion, or &ldquo;heel,&rdquo; of that branch
is allowed to remain on the cutting. This heel may
be nothing more than the curved and hardened base
of the cutting at its point of attachment, as in the
cornus cutting, <a href="#fig_44">Fig. 44</a>. Sometimes an entire section
of the parent branch is removed with the cutting, as in
the &ldquo;mallet&rdquo; cuttings of grapes, <a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>. Of course,
comparatively few heel or mallet cuttings can be made
from a plant, as only one cutting is obtained from a
branch, and it is advisable, therefore, to &ldquo;cut to
buds&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;cut to heels;&rdquo; yet there are many
plants which demand a heel, if satisfactory results are to be
obtained. The requirements of the different species in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
direction can be learned only by experience, but it may be said
that in general the hardest or closest wooded plants require a
heel or a joint at the base.
Willows, currants, basswoods,
and others with
like soft wood, emit roots
readily between the buds,
yet even in these cases propagators
quite usually cut
to buds.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 366px;">
<a name="fig_44" id="fig_44"></a>
<img src="images/fig_44.png" width="366" height="860" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 44. Heel cutting of Cornus.</div>
</div>

<p>Wounds upon plants begin
to heal by the formation
of loose cellular matter
which gives rise to a
mass of tissue known as a
<i>callus</i>. This tissue eventually
covers the entire
wound, if complete healing
results. As a rule, the first
apparent change in a cutting
is the formation of a
callus upon the lower end,
and it is commonly supposed
that this process
must be well progressed
before roots can form.
But roots do not necessarily
arise from the callus, and
in many plants they appear
to bear no relation to it
in position. In willows,
for instance, roots arise
from the bark quite irregularly
and at some distance
from the callus. Yet, as a matter of practice, best results are
obtained from callused cuttings, particularly if the cuttings are
made from mature wood, but this is probably due quite as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
to the fact that considerable time is required for the formation of
the adventitious buds which give rise to the roots as from any connection
between the callusing and rooting processes
themselves. Hard-wood cuttings give better
results when kept dormant for some time after
they are cut. They are usually made in the fall,
and stored during the winter in sand, sawdust or
moss in a cool cellar, or buried in a sandy and well-drained
place. This, at least, is the practice with
hard-wood cuttings of deciduous plants. Hard-wood
evergreen cuttings, when taken in the fall,
are usually set at once, as their foliage will not allow
them to be buried with safety; but in this
case, the cuttings are kept &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; or dormant for
a time, to allow callusing to progress. If cuttings
are buried so deep that they cannot sprout, callusing
may be hastened by placing them in a mild
temperature. Single-eye grape cuttings are sometimes
packed between layers of sand in a barrel
and the barrel is set under a forcing-house bench
where the temperature is about 50&deg;. Eight or ten
inches of sand is usually placed over the top
layer. In this manner, cuttings which have been
obtained in winter or spring can be callused before
planting time.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 122px;">
<a name="fig_45" id="fig_45"></a>
<img src="images/fig_45.png" width="122" height="687" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 45. Mallet cutting of grape.</div>
</div>

<p>It is a singular fact that the lower end of the
cutting, as it stood upon the parent plant, produces
roots and the upper end produces leaves and
shoots, even if the cutting is inverted. And if the
cutting is divided into several parts, each part will
still exhibit this same differentiation of function. This is true
even of root-cuttings, and of other cuttings which possess no
buds. The reasons for this localization of function are not yet
clearly understood, although the phenomenon has lately been
the subject of study. Upon this fact depends the hastening of
the rooting process in inverted cuttings by the direct application
of heat to the bottoms, and it likewise indicates that care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span>
must be taken to plant cuttings in approximately their natural
direction if straight and handsome plants are desired.</p>

<p>The particular method of making the cutting and the treatment
to which it should be subjected, must be determined for
each species or genus. Some plants, as many maples, can be
propagated from wood two or three years old, but in most cases
the wood of the previous or present season&rsquo;s growth is required.
Nearly all soft and loose wooded plants grow readily from hard-wood
cuttings, while those with dense wood are often multiplied
more easily from soft or growing wood. Some plants, as oaks and
hickories, are propagated from cuttings of any description only
with great difficulty. It is probable, however, that all plants can
be multiplied by cuttings if properly treated. It often happens
that one or two species of a closely defined genus will propagate
readily from cuttings while the other species will not, so that the
propagator comes to learn by experience that different treatment
is profitable for very closely related plants. For instance,
most of the viburnums are propagated from layers in commercial
establishments, but <i>V. plicatum</i> is grown extensively from
cuttings.</p>

<p><b>Particular Methods&mdash;Kinds of Cuttings.</b>&mdash;Cuttings are made
from all parts of the plant. In its lowest terms, cuttage is a
division of the plant itself into two or more nearly equal parts,
as in the division of crowns of rhubarb, dicentra, and most
other plants which tend to form broad masses or stools. This
species of cuttage is at times indistinguishable from separation,
as in the dividing of lily bulbs (<a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>), and at other times it is
essentially the same as layerage, as in the dividing of stools
which have arisen from suckers or layers. This breaking or
cutting up of the plants into two or more large parts which are
already rooted is technically known as <i>division</i>. It is only
necessary, in dividing plants, to see that one or more buds or
shoots remain upon the portions, and these portions are then
treated in the same manner as independent mature plants; or
sometimes, when the divisions are small and weak, they may be
handled for a time in a frame or forcing-house in the same manner
as ordinary cuttings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span></p>

<p>Cuttings proper may be divided into four general classes: 1, of
tubers; 2, of roots and root-stocks; 3, of stems; 4, of leaves.</p>

<p><b>1. Tuber Cuttings.</b>&mdash;Tubers are thickened portions of either
roots or stems, and tuber cuttings therefore fall logically under
classes 2 and 3; but they are so unlike ordinary cuttings that
a separate classification is desirable. Tubers are stored with
starch, which is designed to support or supply the plant in time
of need. Tuber cuttings are therefore able to support themselves
for a time if they are placed in conditions suited to their
vegetation. Roots rarely arise from the tubers themselves, but
from the base of the young shoots which spring from them.
This fact is familiarly illustrated in the cuttings of Irish and
sweet potatoes. The young sprouts can be removed and planted
separately and others will arise from the tuber to take their
places. This practice is employed sometimes with new or scarce
varieties of the Irish potato, and three or four crops of rooted
sprouts can be obtained from one tuber. The tuber is cut in
two lengthwise and is then laid in damp moss or loose earth
with the cut surface down, and as soon as the sprouts throw out
roots sufficient to maintain them they are severed and potted
off. Sweet potatoes are nearly always propagated in this manner.</p>

<p>In making tuber cuttings, at least one eye or bud is left to
each piece, if eyes are present; but in root-tubers, like the sweet
potato, there are no buds, and it is only necessary to leave upon
each portion a piece of the epidermis from which adventitious
buds may develop. The pseudo-bulbs of some orchids are
treated in this manner, or the whole bulb is sometimes planted.
A shoot, usually termed an off-shoot, arises from each pseudo-bulb
or each piece of it, and this is potted off as an independent
plant. (See <a href="#Orchids">Orchids</a>, in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.)</p>

<p>Cuttings made from the ordinary stems of some tuberiferous
plants will produce tubers instead of plants. This is the case
sometimes with the potato. The cutting produces a small tuber
near its lower extremity, or sometimes in the axil of a leaf
above ground, and this tuber must be planted to secure a new
plant. Leaf cuttings of some tuberiferous or bulbiferous plants
produce little tubers or bulbs in the same way. Hyacinth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
leaves, inserted in sand in a frame, will soon produce little bulblets
at their base, and these can be removed and planted in the
same manner as the bulbels
described in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>.</p>

<p>Many tubers or tuber-like
portions, which possess a
very moist or soft interior
and a hard or close covering,
vegetate more satisfactorily if allowed to dry for a time before
planting. The pseudo-bulbs of orchids, crowns of pine-apples
and cuttings of cactuses are examples. Portions of cactuses
and pine-apples are sometimes allowed to lie in the sun from
two to four weeks before planting. This treatment dissipates
the excessive moisture and induces the formation of adventitious
buds.</p>

</div>

<p><b>2. Root Cuttings.</b>&mdash;Many plants can be multiplied with ease
by means of short cuttings of the roots, particularly all species
which posses a natural tendency to &ldquo;sucker&rdquo; or send up sprouts
from the root. All
root-stocks or underground
stems
can be made into
cuttings. True root
cuttings possess no
buds whatever;
the buds develop
after the cutting is
planted. Roots
are cut into pieces
from one to three
inches long and are
planted horizontally
in soil or moss.
These cuttings
thrive best with
bottom heat, but blackberries and some other plants, grow readily
with ordinary out-door treatment. A root-cutting of the blackberry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
is shown in <a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. (See <a href="#Blackberry">Blackberry</a>, in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.)
A growing dracæna cutting is exhibited in <a href="#fig_47">Fig. 47</a>. The cuttings
of this plant are handled in a propagating-frame or on a cutting
bench in a warm greenhouse. The bouvardias and many other
plants can be grown in the same manner. Many of the fruit-trees,
as peach, cherry, apple and pear, can be grown readily from these
short root-cuttings in a frame. Variegation cannot always be
transmitted by root-cutting, <i>e. g.</i>, <i>Symphytum asperrimum, variegatum</i>.
Among kitchen garden plants, the horse-radish is the
most familiar example of propagation by root-cuttings. The
small side roots, a fourth inch or so in diameter, are removed
when the horse-radish is dug in fall or spring, and are cut into
four to six inch lengths, as seen in <a href="#fig_48">Fig. 48</a>. These cuttings are
known as &ldquo;sets&rdquo; among gardeners. (See <a href="#Horse-Radish">Horse-radish</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.)
When the crowns of horse-radish are cut and used for
propagation, the operation falls strictly under division, from the
fact that buds or eyes are present; and the same remark applies
to rhubarb, which, however, is not propagated by true root-cuttings.</p>

<p><b>3. Stem Cuttings.</b>&mdash;Cuttings of the stem divide themselves
into two general classes: those known as cutting of the ripe,
mature or hard wood, and cuttings of the green, immature or
soft wood. The two classes run into each other; no hard and
fast lines can be drawn.</p>

<p><i>Hard-wood cuttings</i> are made at any time from late summer
to spring. It is advisable to make them in the fall in order to
allow them to callus before the planting season, and to forestall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
injury which might result to the parent plant from a severe winter.
They may be taken as early as August, or as
soon as the wood is mature, and be stripped of leaves.
Callusing can then take place in time to allow of fall
planting. Or the cuttings taken in early fall may be
planted immediately and be allowed to callus where
they stand. All fall cutting beds should be mulched
to prevent the heaving of the cuttings. As a rule,
however, hard-wood cuttings are buried on a sandy
knoll or are stored in moss, sand or sawdust in a cellar
until spring. (See <a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>.)</p>

<p>There is no general rule to govern the length of
hard-wood cuttings. Most propagators prefer to
make them six to ten inches long, as this is a convenient
length to handle. Two buds are always to be
taken, one bud or one pair at the top and also at the
bottom, but in &ldquo;short-jointed&rdquo; plants more are obtained.
Sometimes all but the top buds are removed
to prevent the appearance of too many shoots. Grape
cuttings are now commonly cut to two or three buds
(<a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>), two being the favorite number for most
varieties. (See <a href="#Grape">Grape</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.) Currant and
gooseberry cuttings (<a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>) usually bear from six to
ten buds. All long hard-wood cuttings are set perpendicularly,
or nearly so, and only one or two buds are
allowed to stand above the surface.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 96px;">
<a name="fig_49" id="fig_49"></a>
<img src="images/fig_49.png" width="96" height="890" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 49. Currant cutting.</div>
</div>

<p>When the stock is rare, cuttings are made of single
eyes or buds. This is particularly the case with the
grape (see <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>), and currants and many other
plants are occasionally grown in the same manner.
<a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a> shows a single eye grape cutting. These cuttings,
whatever the species, are commonly started
under glass with bottom heat, either upon a cutting
bench or in a hot-bed. The soil should be kept uniformly
moist, and when the leaves appear the plants
should be frequently sprinkled. In from thirty to
forty days the plants are ready to pot off. Single eye cuttings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
are usually started about three or four months before the season
is fit for out-door planting, or about February in the northern
states. The most advisable
method of
treatment varies with
the season and locality
as well as with the
species or variety. It is well known, for instance, that the Delaware
grape can be propagated more easily in some regions than
in others. A common style of single eye cutting is made with the
eye close to the top end, and a naked base of an inch or two.
This is inserted into the soil perpendicularly, with the eye just
above the surface. It is much used for a variety of plants.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 420px;">
<a name="fig_50" id="fig_50"></a>
<img src="images/fig_50.png" width="420" height="83" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 50. Single-eye Grape cutting.</div>
</div>

<p>Many coniferous plants are increased by cuttings on a large
scale, especially retinosporas, arbor-vitæs, and the like. Cuttings
are made of the mature wood, which is planted at once (in
autumn) in sand under cover, usually in a cool greenhouse.
Most of the species root slowly and they often remain in the
original flats or benches a year, but their treatment is usually
simple. In some cases junipers, yews and <i>Cryptomeria Japonica</i>
will not make roots for nearly twelve months, keeping in good
foliage however, and ultimately giving good plants. (For more explicit
directions, see Thuya and Retinospora in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.)</p>

<p>Most remarkable instances of propagation by means of portions
of stems are on record. Chips from a tree trunk have
been known to produce plants, and the olive is readily increased
by knots or excrescences formed upon the trunks of old trees.
These excrescences occur in many plants and are known as
<i>knaurs</i>. They are often abundant about the base of large
plane-trees. But they are not often used for purposes of propagation.
Whole trunks will sometimes grow after having been
cut for many months, especially of such plants as cactuses,
many euphorbias and yuccas. And sections of these spongy
trunks will grow, also. Even saw-logs of our common trees, as
elm and ash, will sprout while in the &ldquo;boom,&rdquo; or water.</p>

<p><i>Green-wood cuttings</i> are more commonly employed than those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
from the mature wood, as they &ldquo;strike&rdquo; more quickly, they can
be handled under glass in the winter, and more species can be
propagated by them than by hard-wood cuttings. &ldquo;Slips&rdquo; are
green-wooded cuttings, but the term is often restricted to designate
those which are made by pulling or &ldquo;slipping&rdquo; off a small
side shoot. All soft-wooded plants and many ornamental shrubs
are increased by green cuttings. There are two general classes of
green-wood cuttings: those made from the soft and still growing
wood, and those made from the nearly ripened green-wood, as in
<i>Azalea Indica</i>, oleander, ficus, etc. House plants, as geraniums,
coleuses, carnations, fuchsias, and the like, are grown from the
soft young wood, and many harder-wooded plants are grown in
the same way. Sometimes truly hard wood is used, as in
camellia.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 321px;">
<a name="fig_51" id="fig_51"></a>
<img src="images/fig_51.png" width="321" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 51. Tough and brittle wood.</div>
</div>

<p>In making cuttings from soft and growing shoots, the first
thing to learn is the proper texture or age of shoot. A very soft
and flabby cutting does not grow readily, or if it does it is particularly
liable to damp-off, and it usually makes a weak plant.
Too old wood is slow to root,
makes a poor plant and is handled
with difficulty in many
species. The ordinary test for
beginners is the manner in
which the shoot breaks. If,
upon being bent, the shoot
snaps off squarely so as to
hang together with only a bit
of bark, as in the upper break
in <a href="#fig_51">Fig. 51</a>, it is in the proper
condition for cuttings; but if
it bends or simply crushes, as
in the lower portion of the
figure, it is either too old or
too young for good results.
The tips of the shoots of soft-wooded plants are usually employed,
and all or a portion of the leaves are allowed to remain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
They are inserted in sharp sand to a sufficient depth to hold
them in place, and the atmosphere and soil must be kept moist
to prevent wilting or
"flagging". The cuttings
should also be
shaded for the first
week or two. A propagating-frame
is often
employed. Soft cuttings
are commonly
cut below a bud or cut
to a heel, but this is
unnecessary in easily
rooted plants like geranium, coleus, heliotrope, etc. <a href="#fig_52">Fig. 52</a>
shows an oleander cutting at <i>a</i>, a carnation at <i>b</i>, and a geranium
at <i>c</i>. A coleus cutting is illustrated in <a href="#fig_53">Fig. 53</a>. Sometimes the
growth is so short or the stock so scarce that the cutting cannot
be made long enough to hold itself in the soil. In such case a
toothpick or splinter is tied to the cutting to hold it erect, as in
the cactus cutting, <a href="#fig_54">Fig. 54</a>, or the geranium cutting, <a href="#fig_55">Fig. 55</a>. In
the window garden, soft cuttings may be started in a deep plate
which is filled half or two-thirds full of sand and is then filled to
the brim with water, and not shaded; this method, practiced on
a larger scale, is sometimes useful during the hot summer
months. If bottom heat is desired, the plate may be set upon
the back part of the kitchen
stove. Oleanders usually root
best when mature shoots are
placed in bottles of water.</p>

</div>

<p>Cuttings from the nearly mature
green-wood are employed
for hard-wooded trees and
shrubs, as diervillas (weigela),
roses, hydrangeas, lilacs, etc.
They are cut in essentially the
same manner as the hard-wood cuttings described on <a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>.
They are often taken in summer when the buds have developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">« 59 »</a></span>
and the wood has about attained its growth. They are cut to
two to four or five buds and are planted an inch or two deep in
shaded frames. They are kept close for some days
after setting, and the tops are sprinkled frequently.
Care must be taken not to set them too deep; they are
rarely put in over an inch, if the cutting is six or seven
inches long. &ldquo;June stock cuttings&rdquo; are sometimes
advantageously made; here the young shoots of hardy
shrubs are taken, when about two to three inches
long, the leaves partly removed, and they are planted
under glass, precisely as the geranium is treated in the
autumn. Several weeks are required for rooting, but
good plants are obtained which, when wintered in a
cold-frame, can be planted out in beds the next spring.
Great care must be given to shading and watering.
<i>Hydrangea paniculata</i> var. <i>grandiflora</i>, and <i>Akebia
quinata</i> are examples; or any
deutzia or more easily handled
plant of which stock is scarce
may be cited.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 85px;">

<img src="images/fig_54.png" width="85" height="407" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 54. Cactus cutting held by splinter.</div>
</div>

<p>Part of the leaves are removed,
as a rule, before the cuttings are set, as
shown in the rose cutting, <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>, and
the hydrangea cutting, <a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57</a>. This is
not essential, however, but it lessens
evaporation and the tendency to &ldquo;flag&rdquo;
or wilt. In most species the top can be
cut off the cutting, as seen in Figs. <a href="#fig_44">44</a>
and <a href="#fig_57">57</a>, but in other cases it seriously
injures the cutting. <a href="#fig_58">Fig. 58</a> shows a
weigela cutting from which the top was
clipped. An unusually large callus formed
at the bottom, but the leaves shrivelled
and the cutting is dead. This frequently
occurs in what some nurserymen call
&ldquo;end growers,&rdquo; among which may be mentioned weigelas
(properly diervillas), the shrubby altheas, <i>Cercis Japonica</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
such spireas as <i>S. cratægifolia</i>, <i>S. rotundifolia</i> var. <i>alba</i> and <i>S.
Cantonensis</i> (<i>S. Reevesii</i> of the trade) var. <i>robusta</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>These hardened cuttings, about two
inches long, are often made in the winter
from forced plants. This is particularly
the case with roses (which see in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>).
Cuttings taken in February, in the
north, will be ready to transfer to borders
or nursery beds when spring opens. Stout,
well-rooted stock-plants are used from
which to obtain these cuttings, and they
are cut back when taken to the house in
the fall in order
to induce a good
growth. Many
hardy shrubs
can be easily
propagated in
this way when
the work is difficult
in the
open air, <i>e. g.</i>, <i>Spiræa Cantonensis</i>
(<i>S. Reevesii</i> of the catalogues) and
<i>S. Van Houttii</i>. Stock plants of the
soft species, like coleus, lantanas and
geraniums, are obtained in like manner.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 57. Hydrangea cutting.</div>
</div>

<p><b>4. Leaf Cuttings.</b>&mdash;Many thick and
heavy leaves may be used as cuttings.
Leaf cuttings are most commonly
employed in the showy-leaved begonias,
in succulents, and in gloxinias,
but many plants can be propagated
by them. Even the cabbage
can be made to grow from leaf cuttings.
The whole leaf may be used, as shown in <a href="#fig_59">Fig. 59</a>. It
is simply laid upon moist sand in a frame and held down by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
splinters thrust through the ribs. The wound made by the peg
induces the formation of roots and a young plant arises. A
half dozen or more plants can be obtained from
one leaf. Some operators cut off the ribs, instead
of wounding them with a prick. Many
gardeners prefer to divide the leaf into two
nearly equal parts, and then set each part, or the
better one, upright in the soil, the severed edge
being covered. This is shown in <a href="#fig_60">Fig. 60</a>. Fewer
plants&mdash;often only one&mdash;are obtained in this
manner, but they are strong.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 153px;">
<a name="fig_58" id="fig_58"></a>
<img src="images/fig_58.png" width="153" height="681" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 58. Clipped Weigela cutting.</div>
</div>

<p>When stock is scarce the leaf may be cut into
several fan-shaped pieces. The whole leaf may
be divided into as many triangular portions as
can be obtained with a portion of the petiole, a
strong rib, or vein at the base; these inserted
and treated like coleus cuttings will all root and
make good plants within a reasonable time, say
six months. This form of cutting should be
two to three inches long by an inch or inch and
one-half wide. Ordinarily, in this style of leaf-cutting,
the petiole or stalk is cut off close to the
leaf and the lower third or fourth of the leaf is
then cut off by a nearly straight cut across the
leaf. This somewhat triangular base is then cut
into as many
wedge-shaped
pieces as there
are ribs in the leaf,
each rib forming the
center of a cutting.
The point of each cutting
should contain a
portion of the petiole.
The points of these
triangular portions are
inserted in the soil a half inch or so, the cutting standing erect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">« 62 »</a></span>
or nearly so. Roots form at the base or point in the ordinary
manner.</p>

<p>Leaf cuttings are handled in the same manner as soft stem-cuttings
so far as temperature and moisture are concerned. There
are comparatively few species in which they form the most available
means of multiplication. In some cases, variegation will
not be reproduced by the rooted leaf. This is true in the ivy-leaved
geranium L&rsquo;Elegante; a good plant can be obtained, but
it reverts to the plain-leaved type.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></p>

<p class="caption2">GRAFTAGE.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Graftage.</b>&mdash;The process or operation of grafting or budding, or the
state or condition of being grafted or budded.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Grafting.</b>&mdash;The operation of inserting a bud or a cion in a stock. It
is commonly restricted to the operation of inserting cions of two or more
buds, in distinction from budding, or the operation of inserting a single
bud in the stock; but there are no essential differences between the two
operations.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Stock.</b>&mdash;In graftage, a plant or part of a plant upon which a cion or
bud is set. A <i>free stock</i> is a seedling, in distinction from a grafted stock.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>Cion or Scion.</b>&mdash;A portion of a plant which is mechanically inserted upon
the same or another plant (stock) with the intention that it shall grow.</p>


<p>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.&mdash;Graftage is rarely employed
for the propagation of the species, as seedage
and cuttage are more expeditious and cheaper. Its
chief use is to perpetuate a variety which does not reproduce
itself from seeds and which cannot be economically grown from
cuttings.</p>

<p>Nearly all the named varieties of tree fruits and many of
those of ornamental trees and shrubs are perpetuated by means
of graftage. In some species which present no marked varieties,
however, propagation by seeds or cuttings is for various
reasons so difficult or uncertain that recourse must be had to
graftage. This is particularly true in many of the firs and
spruces which do not produce seeds to any extent in cultivation.
In other cases graftage is performed for the purpose of
producing some radical change in the character or habit of the
plants, as in the dwarfing of pears by grafting them upon the
quince, the elevation of weeping tops by working them upon
upright trunks, and the acceleration of fruit-bearing by setting
cions in old plants. It is sometimes employed to aid the healing
of wounds or to repair and fill out broken tops. And it has
been used to make infertile plants fertile, by grafting in the missing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
sex in di&#339;cious trees, or a variety with more potent pollen
as practiced in some of the native plums. All these uses of
graftage fall under three heads: 1. To perpetuate a variety.
2. To increase ease and speed of multiplication. 3. To produce
some radical change in nature or habit of cion or stock.</p>

<p>Probably all exogenous plants&mdash;those which possess a distinct
bark and pith&mdash;can be grafted. Plants must be more or less
closely related to each other to allow of successful graftage of
the one upon the other. What the affinities are in any case can
be known only by experiment. As a rule, plants of close
botanical relationship, especially those of the same genus, graft
upon each other with more or less ease; yet this relationship is
by no means a safe guide. A plant will often thrive better upon
a species of another genus than upon a congener. The pear,
for instance, does better upon many thorns than upon the apple.
Sometimes plants of very distinct genera unite readily. Thus
among cacti the leafless epiphyllum grows remarkably well
upon the leaf-bearing pereskia. It should be borne in mind
that union of tissues is not a proof of affinity. Affinity can be
measured only by the thrift, healthfulness and longevity of the
cion. The bean has been known to make a union with the
chrysanthemum, but it almost immediately died. Soft tissues,
in particular, often combine in plants which possess no affinity
whatever, as we commonly understand the term. Neither
does affinity refer to relative sizes or rates of growth of stock
and cion, although the term is sometimes used in this sense. It
cannot be said that some varieties of pear lack affinity for the
quince, and yet the pear cion grows much larger than the stock.
In fact, it is just this difference in size and rate of growth which
constitutes the value of the quince root for dwarfing the pear.
When there is a marked difference in rate of growth between
the stock and cion, an enlargement will occur in the course
of time, either above or below the union. If this occurs upon
the stem, it makes an unsightly tree. If the cion greatly outgrows
the stock a weak tree is the result.</p>

<p>Graftage can be performed at almost any time of the year,
but the practice must be greatly varied to suit the season and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
other conditions. The one essential point is to make sure that
the cambium layers, lying between the bark and wood, meet as
nearly as possible in the cion and stock. This cambium is always
present in live parts, forming woody substance from its
inner surface and bark from its outer surface. During the
season of greatest growth it usually occurs as a soft, mucilaginous
and more or less unorganized substance, and in this stage it
most readily repairs and unites wounded surfaces. And for this
reason the grafting and budding of old trees are usually performed
in the spring. Later in the season, the cambium becomes
firmer and more differentiated, and union of woody parts
is more uncertain. It is also necessary to cover the wounds in
order to check evaporation from the tissues. In out-door work
wax is commonly used for all species of graftage which wound
the wood itself, but in budding, the loosened bark, bound down
securely by a bandage, affords sufficient protection. It is commonly
supposed that an ordinary cleft-graft cannot live if the
bark of the stock immediately adjoining it is seriously wounded,
but the bark really serves little purpose beyond protection of
the tissues beneath. A cion will grow when the bark is entirely
removed from the stub if some adequate protection can be given
which will not interfere with the formation of new bark. The
cion must always possess at least one good bud. In most cases,
only buds which are mature or nearly so are used, but in the
grafting of herbs very young buds may be employed. These
simple requirements can be satisfied in an almost innumerable
variety of ways. The cion or bud may be inserted in the root,
crown, trunk or any of the branches; it may be set under the
bark simply or inserted into the wood itself in almost any fashion;
and the operation may be performed either upon growing
or dormant plants at any season. But in practice there are
comparatively few methods which are sufficiently simple and
expeditious to admit of general use.</p>

<p>Graftage may be divided into three general divisions, between
which, however, there are no decisive lines of separation: 1.
Bud-grafting or budding, in which a single bud is inserted upon
the surface of the wood of the stock. 2. Cion-grafting or grafting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
proper, in which a detached twig bearing one or more buds
is inserted into or upon the stock. 3. Inarching or grafting by
approach, in which the cion remains attached to the parent
plant until union takes place. Each of these divisions can be
almost endlessly varied and sub-divided, but in this discussion
only the leading practices can be detailed. The following
enumeration, after Baltet, will give a fair idea of the kinds of
grafting which have been employed under distinct names:</p>

<p><b>Particular Methods.</b>&mdash;<i>Budding.</i> Budding is the operation of
inserting a single bud, bearing little or no wood, upon the surface
of the stock. The bud is nearly always inserted under the bark
of the stock, but in flute-budding a piece of bark is entirely removed
and the bud is used to cover the wound. There is no
general rule to determine what species of plants should be budded
and which ones cion grafted. In fact, the same species is
often multiplied by both operations. Plants with thin bark and
an abundance of sap are likely to do best when grafted; or if
they are budded, the buds should be inserted at a season when
the sap is least abundant to prevent the &ldquo;strangulation&rdquo; or
&ldquo;throwing out&rdquo; of the bud. In such species the bark is not
strong enough to hold the bud firmly until it unites; and solid
union does not take place until the flow of sap lessens. Budding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
is largely employed upon nearly all young fruit-trees, and almost
universally so upon the stone-fruits. It is also used in roses,
and many ornamental trees. Budding is commonly performed
during the growing season, usually in late summer or early fall,
because mature buds can be procured at that time and young
stocks are then large enough to be worked readily. But budding
can be done in early spring, just as soon as the bark
loosens; in this case perfectly dormant buds must have been
taken in winter. Budding is always best performed when the
bark slips or peels easily. It can be done when the bark is
tight, but the operation is then tedious and uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shield-budding.</span>&mdash;There is but one style of budding in general
use in this country. This is known as shield-budding, from
the shield-like shape of the portion of bark which is removed
with the bud. Technically, the entire severed portion, comprising
both bark and bud, is called a &ldquo;bud.&rdquo; A shield bud is
shown natural size in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>. This is cut from a young twig
of the present season&rsquo;s growth. It is inserted underneath the
bark of a young stock or branch, and is then securely tied, as
shown in <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 96px;">
<a name="fig_61" id="fig_61"></a>
<img src="images/fig_61.png" width="96" height="211" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 61. Shield-bud.</div>
</div>

<p>The minor details of shield-budding differ with nearly every
operator. In commercial practice, it is performed in the north
from early July until the middle of September. In the southern
states it usually begins in June. As a rule, apples and pears
are budded before peaches. This is due to the fact that peach-stocks
are nearly always budded the same season the
pits are planted, and the operation must be delayed
until the stocks are large enough to be worked.
Most other fruit-stocks, especially apples and pears,
are not budded until two years after the seeds are
sown. The plants grow for the first season in a
seed-bed. The next spring they are transplanted
into nursery rows, and budded when they become
large enough, which is usually the same year they
are transplanted. The nurseryman reckons the
age of his stock from the time of transplanting, and the age
of the marketable tree from the time when the buds or grafts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span>
begin to grow. The young stocks are &ldquo;dressed&rdquo; or trimmed
before being set into the nursery. This operation consists
in cutting off a fourth or third of the top and the
tap root. This causes the roots to spread and induces
a vigorous growth of top because it reduces the numbers
of shoots; and such stocks are more expeditiously
handled than long and untrimmed ones.</p>

<p>Stocks should be at least three-eighths inch in diameter
to be budded with ease. Just before the buds are
set, the leaves are removed from the base of the stock
so that they will not interfere with the operation.
They are usually rubbed off with the hand for a
space of five or six inches above the ground. They
should not be removed more than two or three days in
advance of budding, else the growth of the parts will
be checked and the bark will set; any branches, too,
as in the quince, which might impede the work of the
budder, are to be cut off at the same time. The bud
is inserted an inch or two above the surface of the
ground or as low down as the budder can work. The
advantage of setting the bud low is to bring the resulting
crook or union where it will not be seen. It is a common
and good practice, also, to place the bud upon the
north side of the stock to shield it from the sun.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 84px;">
<a name="fig_62" id="fig_62"></a>
<img src="images/fig_62.png" width="84" height="688" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 62. A stick of buds.</div>
</div>

<p>The buds are taken from strong and well-hardened
shoots of the season&rsquo;s growth and of the desired
variety. Usually the whole of the present growth is
cut, the leaves are removed, but a part of the petiole
or stalk of each leaf is left (as in Figs. <a href="#fig_61">61</a> and <a href="#fig_62">62</a>) to
serve as a handle to the bud. This trimmed shoot is
then called a &ldquo;stick.&rdquo; A stick may bear two dozen good buds
when the growth has been strong, but only ten or twelve buds
are commonly secured. The upper buds, which are commonly
not fully grown and which are borne on soft wood, are usually
discarded. The buds are cut with a thin-bladed sharp knife.
Various styles of budding knives are in use, and the budder
usually has decided preferences for some particular pattern.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
The essentials of a good budding-knife are these: the very best
steel, a thin blade which has a curved cutting end (as shown in
Figs. <a href="#fig_63">63</a> and <a href="#fig_66">66</a>), and lightness. The curved end of the blade is
used for making the incisions in the stock. The handle of the
budding-knife usually runs into a thin bone scalpel at the end,
and this portion is designed for the lifting or loosening of the
bark on the stock. Some budders, however, raise the bark with
the blade. A good form of blade, but one seldom made, has
a rounded end, the upper side of the curve being ground simply
to a thin edge. This blade may be used both for cutting the
bark and loosening it, thus overcoming the necessity of reversing
the knife every time a bud is set. If this form of blade were
commonly known it would undoubtedly soon come into favor.
The blade of a common budding-knife can be ground to this
shape.</p>

<p>The bud is usually cut about an inch long. Most budders cut
from below upwards, but some prefer to make a downward incision.
It does not matter just how the bud is cut, if the surfaces
are smooth and even and the bud is not too thick. On a
stick a fourth or three-eighths inch through, the cut, at its deepest
point just under the bud, is about one-fourth the diameter of the
twig. A bit of wood is therefore removed with the bud, as
shown in <a href="#fig_61">Fig. 61</a>. There is some discussion as to whether this
wood should be left upon the bud, but no definite experiments
have been made to show that it is injurious to the resulting tree.
Some budders remove the wood with the point of the knife or
by a deft twist as the bud is removed from the stick. But buds
appear to live equally well with wood attached or removed.
Some propagators cut the buds as they go, while others prefer
to cut a whole stick before setting any, letting each bud hang by
a bit of bark at the top and which is cut off squarely when
wanted, as shown in <a href="#fig_62">Fig. 62</a>.</p>

<p>The wound or matrix which is to receive the bud is made by
two incisions, one vertical and one transverse (<a href="#fig_63">Fig. 63</a>). These
are light cuts, extending only through the bark. The vertical
slit is usually made first and by the rounded end of the blade.
This is an inch or inch and a half long. The transverse cut is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
made across the top of the vertical cut by one rocking motion
of the blade towards the body. The corners of the bark may
be lifted a little by an outward
motion of the blade so as to
allow the bud to be pushed in,
but unless the bark slips very
freely it will have to be loosened
by the end of the blade or by the
scalpel on the reverse end of the
handle, as previously described.
The bud is now inserted in the
cleft of the bark. It is pushed
down part way by the fingers, as
in <a href="#fig_64">Fig. 64</a>, but it is usually
driven home by pushing down
upon the leaf-stalk handle with
the back of the knife-blade.
The entire bud should pass into
the cleft; or if a portion of it
should project above it should be cut off. If the bark peels
freely, the bud will slip in easily and will follow the cleft, but if
it sticks somewhat, more care is necessary to prevent the bud
from running out. If the bark is very tight, it may have to be
loosened with the knife throughout the length of the cleft; but
budding should be performed, if possible, when such pains are
not necessary.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 244px;">

<img src="images/fig_63.png" width="244" height="426" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 63. Preparing the stock.</div>
</div>

<p>The bud must now be tied. The whole matrix should be
closed and bound securely, as represented in <a href="#fig_65">Fig. 65</a>. The dotted
lines parallel with the cleft show the extent to which the bud
projects under the bark. The string is usually started below
the bud, the end being held by lapping the second course over it,
and the upper end being secured by drawing a bow through
under the upper course. Care should be taken not to bind the
string over the bud itself. The strings are previously cut the
required length&mdash;about a foot&mdash;and the tying is performed very
quickly. Any soft cord can be employed. Yarn and carpet
warp are sometimes used. The most common material, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span>
until the last few years, has been bass matting. This is the
inner bark of the bass-wood or linden. The bark is stripped in
early summer, and the inner
portion is macerated or &ldquo;rotted&rdquo;
in water for four or five weeks.
It is then removed, cut into the
desired lengths, and stripped into
narrow bands&mdash;one-fourth to
one-half inch wide&mdash;when it
may be sorted and stored away
for future use. If it is stiff and
harsh when it comes from the
maceration, it should be pounded
lightly or rubbed through the
hands until it becomes soft and
pliable. The best tying material
which we now have is undoubtedly
raffia. It is an imported
article, coming from the eastern
tropics (the product of the palm
<i>Raphia Ruffia</i>), but it is so cheap
that it will probably supersede
even bass-bark. It is strong and pliable, and is an excellent
material for tying up plants in the greenhouse, or small ones
out-doors. The greatest disadvantage in its use in the budding
field is its habit of rolling when it becomes dry.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 202px;">

<img src="images/fig_64.png" width="202" height="525" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 64. Bud entering matrix.</div>
</div>

<p>In two or three weeks after the bud is set it will have &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;
or united to the stock. The bandage must then be removed or
cut. It is the common practice to draw a budding-knife over
the strings, on the side opposite the bud, completely severing
them and allowing them to fall off as they will. If the strings
are left on too long they will constrict the stem and often kill the
bud, and they also have a tendency to cause the bud to &ldquo;break&rdquo;
or begin to grow. The bud should remain perfectly dormant
until spring, for if it should begin to grow it will be injured and
perhaps killed by the winter. It should remain green and
fresh; if it shrivels and becomes brown, even though it still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">« 73 »</a></span>
adheres to the stock, it is worthless. Advantage can be taken,
when cutting the tyings, to rebud any stocks which have failed.
If the bud should begin to grow,
because of a warm and wet fall or
other reasons, there is little remedy
except perhaps to head the shoot
back if it should become long
enough. If the stocks are protected
by snow during winter, some of the
buds at the base of the shoot may
pass the cold in safety.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 168px;">
<a name="fig_65" id="fig_65"></a>
<img src="images/fig_65.png" width="168" height="445" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 65. The bud tied.</div>
</div>

<p>The next spring the stock should
be cut off just above the bud (<a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a>),
in order to throw the entire
force of the plant into the bud. If
the root is strong and the soil good,
the bud will grow two or three feet
the first year; or peaches and
cherries will grow from two to three
times that height. All sprouts
should be kept rubbed off the stock, and the bud should be
trained to a single stem. In some weak and crooked growers,
the new shoot must be tied, and some propagators in such cases
cut off the stock five or six inches above the bud and let it serve
as a stake to which to tie. The stock, of course, must not be
allowed to grow. Late in the season the stock is cut down close
to the bud, as in <a href="#fig_66">Fig. 66</a>. Peaches and some other fruits are
sold after having made one season&rsquo;s growth from the bud, but
pears, apples, and most other trees are not often sold until the
second or third year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;June budding&rdquo; is a term applied to the budding of stocks in
early summer while they are yet growing rapidly. It is employed
mostly at the south where the stocks can be grown to
sufficient size by the last of June or first of July. Small stocks
are usually employed&mdash;those ranging from one-fourth to one-third
inch being preferred. A few strong leaves should be left
on the stock below the bud, and after the bud has &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
whole top should not be cut off at once, else the growing plant
will receive a too severe check. It is best to bend the top over
to check its growth or remove the
leaves gradually. The bandages
should not be left on longer than
six to ten days if the stock is
growing rapidly. To prevent the
constriction of the stem, muslin
bands are sometimes used instead
of bass or raffia. In hot and dry
climates the bud should be set an
inch or two higher in June budding
than in the ordinary practice,
to escape the great heat of the
soil. June budding is used upon
the peach more than any other
tree, although it can be employed
for any species which will give
large enough stocks from seed by
the June following the sowing. In peaches, the bud will produce
a shoot from three to five feet high the same season the
buds are set, so that marketable budded trees can be produced in
one season from the seed.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 257px;">

<img src="images/fig_66.png" width="257" height="419" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 66. Cutting off the stock.</div>
</div>

<p>A different kind of early summer budding is sometimes performed
upon apples and other fruit-trees. In this case the
stocks are one or two years old from the transplanting, and dormant
buds are used. These buds are cut the previous fall or
winter in the same manner as cions, and when spring approaches
they are put on ice&mdash;in sawdust, sand or moss&mdash;and kept until
the stocks are large enough to receive them. The particular advantage
of this method is the distributing of the labor of budding
over a longer season, thereby avoiding the rush which often
occurs at the regular budding time.</p>

<p>Budders usually carry a number of &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; with them when
they enter the nursery. These may be carried in the pocket, or
thrust into the boot-leg; or some budders carry four or five sticks
in the hand. The budder follows a row throughout its length,
passing over those trees which are too small to work. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
common practice to rest upon one knee while budding, as shown
in <a href="#fig_67">Fig. 67</a>, but some prefer to use a low stool. The tying is
usually done by a boy,
who should follow close
behind the budder in
order that the buds
shall not dry out. An
expert budder will set
from 1,000 to 3,000 buds
a day, in good stock, and
with a boy (or two of
them for the latter
speed) to tie. Peach
stocks are more rapidly
budded than most others, as the bark is firm and slips easily, and
some remarkable records are made by skillful workmen.</p>

</div>

<p>Budding is sometimes employed the same as top-grafting for
changing over the top of an old tree from one variety to another.
The buds cannot be easily inserted in very old and stiff bark, but
in all smooth and fresh bark they work readily. Sometimes old
trees are severely pruned the year before the budding is to be
done, in order to obtain young shoots in which to set the buds.
In fruit-trees six or seven years old or less, budding is fully as
advantageous as grafting. New varieties are also budded into
old branches in order to hasten bearing for the purpose of testing
the variety. Here budding has a distinct advantage over
grafting, as it uses fewer buds, and the wood of new sorts is
often scarce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flute-Budding.</span>&mdash;An occasional method of budding is that
known under the general name of flute-budding. In this
method the bud is not covered by the bark of the stock as in
shield-budding. <a href="#fig_68">Fig. 68</a> illustrates it. A portion of bark is removed
entirely from the stock, and a similar piece is fitted into
its place. When the wound extends only part way about the
stem, as in the illustration, the operation is sometimes known as
veneer-budding. When it extends entirely around the stem it is
called ring or annular-budding. Flute-budding is usually performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
late in spring. It is best adapted to plants with very
thick and heavy bark. The bud is tied and afterwards treated
in essentially the same manner as in shield-budding.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 151px;">

<img src="images/fig_68.png" width="151" height="395" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 68. Flute-budding.</div>
</div>

<p>A species of flute-budding in which a ring of
bark is slipped down upon the tip of a shoot,
which has been girdled for the purpose, is
called whistle-budding or tubular-budding.</p>

<p><i>Grafting.</i>&mdash;Grafting is divided in various
ways, but chiefly with reference to the position
of the union upon the plant and to the method in
which the scion and stock are joined. In reference
to position, there are four general
classes: 1. Root-grafting, in which the stock
is entirely a root. 2. Crown-grafting, which is
performed upon the crown or collar of the
plant just at the surface of the ground, an
operation which is often confounded with root-grafting.
3. Stem-grafting, in which the cion
is set on the trunk or body of the tree below the limbs, a
method occasionally employed with young trees. 4. Top-grafting,
or grafting in the branches of the tree. Any method of
inserting the cion may be employed in these classes. The best
classification, particularly for purposes of description, is that
which considers methods of making the union. Some of these
kinds of grafting are catalogued on <a href="#Page_66">page 66</a>. For our purposes,
we shall need to consider only the whip, saddle, splice, veneer,
cleft and bark-grafting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whip-Grafting.</span>&mdash;Whip or tongue-grafting is employed only
on small stocks, usually upon those one or two years old.
Both the cion and stock are cut across diagonally, the cut surface
extending from one to two inches according to the size of the
part. A vertical cleft is then made in both, and the two are
joined by shoving the tongue of the cion into the cleft of the
stock. The operation can be understood by reference to Figs.
<a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a>, <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a> and <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>. <a href="#fig_69">Fig. 69</a> shows the end of a cion, cut natural
size. The stock is cut in the same manner, and the two are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
joined in Figs. <a href="#fig_70">Fig. 70</a> and <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>. The parts are held firmly by a
bandage passed five or six times around them. If the graft is to
stand above ground, the wound must be protected by
applying wax over the bandage. (Recipes for wax
can be found at the end of this chapter.)</p>

<p>Root-grafting, especially of fruit-stocks, is performed
almost entirely by the whip-graft. This operation is
performed in winter. The stocks, either one or two
years old, are dug and stored in the fall. In January
or February the grafting is begun. In true root-grafting,
only pieces of roots are used, but some prefer
to use the whole root and graft at the crown. In
piece-root-grafting, from two to four trees are made
from a single root. A piece of root from two to four
inches long is used, as shown in <a href="#fig_71">Fig. 71</a>. The
parts are usually held by winding with waxed
string or waxed bands. The string should be
strong enough to hold the parts securely and
yet weak enough to be broken without hurting the
hands. No. 18 knitting cotton answers this purpose
admirably. It should be bought in balls, which are
allowed to stand for a few minutes in melted wax. The
wax soon saturates the ball. Waxed bands are made
by spreading melted wax over thin muslin, which is
cut into narrow strips when dry. The string is the
more useful for rapid work. The grafts are packed
away in sand, moss or sawdust in a cool cellar until
spring, when the two parts will be firmly callused together.
Some propagators are now discarding all tying
of root-grafts. The grafts are packed away snugly, and
if the storage cellar is cool&mdash;not above 40&deg;&mdash;they will
knit together so that they can be planted without danger
of breaking apart. If the cellar is warm the grafts
will start into growth and be lost.</p>

<p>Cions are cut in fall or winter, or any time before the
buds swell in spring. Only the previous year&rsquo;s growth
is used in all ordinary cases, but in maples and some other trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
older wood may be used. In the grafting of peaches&mdash;which is
very rarely done&mdash;the best cions are supposed to be those which
bear a small portion of two-year-old at the
lower end. This portion of old wood probably
serves no other purpose than a mechanical one,
as the recent wood is soft and pithy. It is a
common opinion that cions are worthless if cut
during freezing weather, but this is unfounded.
The cions are stored in sand, moss or sawdust
in a cool cellar, or they may be buried in a
sandy place. Or sometimes, when a few are
wanted for top-grafting, they are thrust into
the ground beside the tree into which they are
to be set the following spring. Only well-formed
and mature buds should be used. Sometimes
flower-buds are inserted for the purpose
of fruiting a new or rare variety the following
year.</p>

</div>

<p>In common root-grafting in the east and
south, the cion bears about three buds, and the
root is about the same length, or perhaps
shorter. The variable and unknown character
of these roots as regards hardiness, renders it
important in very severe climates that roots
should be obtained from the same plant as the
cion, the hardiness of which is known. It is,
therefore, the practice in the prairie countries
to use a very long cion&mdash;eight inches to a foot&mdash;and
to set it in the ground to the top bud. The
piece of root serves as a temporary support, and
roots are emitted along the cion. When the
tree is ready for sale the old piece of root is often removed, or
sometimes it falls away of itself. In this manner own-rooted
trees are obtained, and it is for this reason that root-grafting is
more universally practiced west of the Great Lakes than budding.
Even cions of ordinary length often emit roots, as seen
in <a href="#fig_72">Fig. 72</a>, but the cions are not long enough to reach into uniformly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span>
moist soil. Some varieties of fruit-trees are found
in practice to root more readily than others.</p>

<p>There is much discussion as
to the relative merits of budding
and root-grafting fruit-stocks,
but the observations are
usually so indefinite or irrelevant
that safe conclusions cannot
be drawn from them. We
have seen that root-grafting
serves an indispensable purpose
in the cold prairie regions
by enabling nurserymen to
secure own-rooted trees of
known hardiness. Aside from
this it may be said that root-grafting
is cheaper than budding,
as it is performed when
labor is cheap and two or more
trees are made from one stock,
Budded or crown-grafted trees
possess a greater root and
usually make a stronger
growth, at least the first year
or two, and it has been said
that their roots are more
numerous and more symmetrically
disposed. But there is
not yet a sufficient knowledge
of the subject in all its details
to allow of dogmatic expressions
upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saddle-Grafting.</span>&mdash;Saddle-grafting
is a simple and
useful method for the shoots
of small, growing plants. The
stock is cut to a wedge-shaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">« 80 »</a></span>
end by two cuts, and the cion is split and set upon the wedge
(<a href="#fig_73">Fig. 73</a>). The union is then tied and waxed in the same way as
exposed whip-grafts. It is oftenest employed when
a terminal bud is used, as the wood in such cions is
usually too weak to work well with a tongue.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 74. Splice-grafting.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Splice-Grafting.</span>&mdash;The simplest form of grafting
is that shown in <a href="#fig_74">Fig. 74</a>, in which the two parts
are simply cut across diagonally and laid together.
The parts are held only by the string, which, together
with the wax, is applied in the same way as
upon the whip-graft. Splice-grafting is frequently
used upon soft or tender wood which will not admit
of splitting. It is adapted only to small
shoots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Veneer-Grafting.</span>&mdash;<a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a> shows a style
of grafting which is much used, particularly
for ornamentals and for rare stocks which
are grown in pots. An incision is made
upon the stock just through the bark and
about an inch long (<i>A</i>, <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a>), the bit
of bark being removed by means of a
downward sloping cut at its base. The
base of the cion is cut off obliquely, and upon the longest
side a portion of bark is removed, corresponding to
the portion taken from the stock. The little tongue of
bark on the stock covers the base of the cion, when it is
set. The cion is tied tightly to the stock (<i>B</i>, <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a>),
usually with raffia. This method of grafting makes no
incision into the wood, and all the wounded surfaces are
completely covered by the matching of the cion and
stock. It is not necessary, therefore, to wax over the
wounds, as a rule. The parts grow together quickly
and uniformly, making a solid and perfect union as
shown at <i>D</i>, <a href="#fig_75">Fig. 75</a>. So far as the union of the
parts is concerned, this is probably the ideal method of
grafting. This method, which is nothing but the side-graft of
the English gardeners with the most important condition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
the longer tongue on the stock, is known by various names, but
it is oftenest called veneer-grafting in this country.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 414px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 75. Veneer-grafting.</div>
</div>

<p>Veneer-grafting is
employed mostly from
November to March
upon potted plants.
Stocks which are
grown out-doors are
potted in the early fall
and carried in a cool
house or pit. The cion
is applied an inch or
two above the surface
of the soil, and the
stock need not be
headed back until the
cion has united. (See
<a href="#fig_76">Fig. 76</a>.) Both dormant
and growing
cions are used. All
plants in full sap must
be placed under a
frame in the house, in which they can be almost entirely buried
with sphagnum, not too wet, and the house must be kept cool
and rather moist until the cions are well established. Some
species can be transferred to the open border or to nursery rows
in the spring, but most plants which are grafted in this way are
handled in pots during the following season. Rhododendrons,
Japanese maples and many conifers are some of the plants
which are multiplied by veneer-grafting. This method, when
used with hardy or tender plants, gives a great advantage in
much experimental work, because the stock is not at all injured
by a failure and can be used over again many times, perhaps
even in the same season; the manipulation is simple and easily
acquired by inexperienced hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleft-Grafting.</span>&mdash;In cleft-grafting the stock is cut off
squarely and split, and into the split a cion with a wedge-shaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
base is inserted. It is particularly adapted to large stocks and
is the method universally employed for top-grafting old trees.
<a href="#fig_77">Fig. 77</a> represents the
operation. The end of
the stock, technically
called a &ldquo;stub,&rdquo; is usually
large enough to accommodate
two cions, one
upon either side. In fact,
it is better to use two
cions, not only because
they double the chances
of success but because
they hasten the healing of
the stub. Cleft-grafting
is at best a harsh process,
especially upon large
limbs, and its evils should
be mitigated as much as
possible. In common
practice, the cion (<a href="#fig_78">Fig. 78</a>) contains three buds,
the lowest one standing
just above the wedge portion.
This lowest bud is usually entirely covered with wax, but
it pushes through without difficulty. In fact, being nearest the
source of food and most protected, its chances of living are
greater than those of the higher buds. The sides of the cion
must be cut smoothly and evenly. A single draw cut on each
side with a sharp blade is much better than two or three partial
cuts. A good grafter makes a cion by three strokes of the knife,
one to cut off the cion and two to shape it. The outer edge of
the wedge should be a little thicker than the inner one so that
the stock will bind upon it and hold it firm at the point where
the union first takes place. These cions are taken in late fall or
winter, and kept in the same manner as directed for whip-grafting
on pages 77 and 78.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 77. Cleft-grafting.</div>
</div>

<p>The stock or stub must be cut off squarely and smoothly with
a sharp and preferably fine-toothed saw. If one desires to be
especially careful in the operation, the
end of the stub, or at least two opposite
sides of it, may be dressed off with a
knife so that the juncture between the
bark and the wood may be more easily
seen. Professional grafters rarely resort
to this practice, however. The stub is
then split to the depth of an inch and a
half or two inches. Various styles of
&ldquo;grafting-knife&rdquo; are used to split the
stub. The best one is that shown in
<a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a>. It is commonly made from an
old file by a blacksmith. The blade is
curved so that the bark of the stub is
drawn in when the knife is entering,
thereby lessening the danger of loosening
the bark. Upon the end of the
knife is a wedge, about four or five
inches long, for opening the cleft. The
wedge is driven into the cleft and allowed
to remain while the cions are being
placed. If the cleft does not open wide
enough to allow the cions to enter, the
operator bears down on the handle of
the knife. The cions must be thrust down to the first bud, or
even deeper, and it is imperative that they fit tightly. The line
of separation between the bark and wood in the cion should meet
as nearly as possible the similar line in the stock. The cions
are usually set a trifle obliquely, the tops projecting outwards,
to ensure the contact of the cambium layers. Writers usually
state that it is imperative to success to have the exact lines
between the bark and wood meet for at least the greater part of
their length, but this is an error. The callus or connecting
tissue spreads beyond its former limits when the wounds begin to
heal. The most essential points are rather to be sure that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">« 84 »</a></span>
cion fits tightly throughout its whole length, and to protect the
wound completely with an air-tight covering.</p>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 77px;">

<img src="images/fig_78.png" width="77" height="627" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 78. Cleft-graft cion.</div>
</div>

<p>The wounds must now be covered with wax. <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>
illustrates a stub after the covering has been applied.
If the grafting is done in early spring when
the weather is cold, the wax will have to be applied
with a brush. The wax is melted in a glue-pot, which
is carried into the tree. But if the weather is warm
enough to soften the wax, it should be applied with
the hands. The hands are first greased to prevent
the wax from sticking. The two side or vertical portions
are applied first. The end of the mass of wax
in the hand is flattened into a thin portion about a
half inch wide. This portion is then laid over the bud
and held there by the thumb of the other hand, while
the wax is drawn downwards over the cleft, being
pressed down firmly upon the bark by the thumb of
the first hand. The wax gradually tails out until it
breaks off just below the lowest point of the cleft.
The flattened upper part is then wrapped around the
cion upon either side, completely and tightly encircling
it. A simple deft wrapping of the wax about the cion
makes a tighter joint than can be secured in twice the
time by any method of pinching it into place. Another
portion of wax is now flattened and applied over the
end of the stub. Many grafters apply a bit of wax to
the tops of the cion also. All the wounds must be
covered securely.</p>

<p>The top-grafting of large trees is an important operation, and
there are many men
who make it a business.
These men usually
charge by the stub and
warrant, the warrant
meaning that one cion
of the stub must be
alive when the counting is done late in summer. From two to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
three cents a stub is a common price. A good grafter in good
&ldquo;setting&rdquo; can graft from 400 to 800 stubs a day and wax them
himself. Much depends upon the size of the
trees, their shape, and the amount of pruning
which must be done before the grafter can work in
them handily. Every man who owns an orchard
of any extent should be able to do his own grafting.
The most important factor in the top-grafting of
an old tree is the shaping of the top. The old top
is to be removed during three or four or five years
and a new one is to be grown in its place. If the
tree is old, the original plan or shape of the top
will have to be followed in its general outlines.
The branches should be grafted, as a rule, where
they do not exceed an inch and a half in diameter,
as cions do better in such branches, the wounds
heal quickly and the injury to the tree is less than
when very large stubs are used. The operator
should endeavor to cut all the leading stubs at approximately
equal distances from the center of
the tree. And then, to prevent the occurrence of
long and pole-like branches, various minor side-branches
should be grafted. These will serve to
fill out the new top and to afford footholds for
pruners and pickers. <a href="#fig_81">Fig. 81</a> is a good illustration
of an old apple tree just top-grafted. Many stubs
should be set, and at least all the prominent branches should be
grafted if the tree has been well-trained. It is better to have
too many stubs and to be obliged to cut out some of them in
after years, than to have too few. In thick-topped trees, care
must be exercised not to cut out so much the first year that the
inner branches will sunburn. All large branches which must
be sacrificed ought to be cut out when the grafting is done, as
they increase in diameter very rapidly after so much of the top
is removed. One horizontal branch lying directly over or under
another should not be grafted, for it is the habit of grafts to
grow upright rather than horizontally in the direction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
branch. It is well to split all stubs on such branches horizontally,
that one cion may not stand directly under another.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 623px;">
<a name="fig_81" id="fig_81"></a>
<img src="images/fig_81.png" width="623" height="639" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 81. Top-grafted old tree.</div>
</div>

<p>Top-grafting is performed in spring. The best time is when
the leaves are pushing out, as wounds made then heal quickly
and cions are most apt to live. But when a large amount of
grafting must be done, it is necessary to begin a month or even
two before the leaves start. On the other hand, the operation
can be extended until a month or more after the leaves are full-grown,
but such late cions make a short growth, which is likely to
perish the following winter. Professional grafters usually divide
their men into three gangs, one to do the cutting of the stubs,
one to set the cions, and one to apply the wax. The cions are
all whittled before the grafter enters the tree. They are then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
usually moistened by dipping into a pail of water and are carried
in a high side-pocket in the jacket. The handiest mallet is a
simple club or billy, a foot and a half
long, hung over the wrist by a loose
soft cord (Fig 82). This is brought
into the palm of the hand by a swinging
motion of the forearm. This mallet
is always in place, never drops from
the tree, and is not in the way. The
knife shown in <a href="#fig_79">Fig. 79</a> is commonly
used. A downward stroke of the mallet
drives the knife into the tree and an
upward motion immediately following
strikes the knife on the outer end and
removes it. Another downward motion
drives in the wedge. The sharpened
nails and sticks commonly pictured as
wedges in cleft-grafting are useless for any serious work. And
the common style of grafting-knife sold by seedsmen, comprising
a thin, broad blade set in a heavy back piece, is also worthless.
The blade is too thin to split the stub. The various
combined implements which have been devised to facilitate cleft-grafting
are usually impracticable in serious operations. A very
good grafting-knife for small stocks or trees in nursery row is
shown in <a href="#fig_83">Fig. 83</a>. This is the Thomas knife. The larger arm
is made entirely of wood. At its upper end is a grooved portion
into which the blade closes. This blade can be made from the
blade of a steel case-knife, and it should be about two and a
half inches long. It is secured to an iron handle. The essential
feature of this implement is the draw cut which is secured
by setting the blades and the pivot in just the positions shown in
the figure. The stock is cut off by the shears, and the cleft is
then made by turning the shears up and making a vertical cut.
The cleft is therefore cut instead of split, insuring a tight fit of
the cions. This tool is particularly useful upon hard and
crooked-grained stocks.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 82. Grafting-mallet.</div>
</div>

<p>Cleft-grafting is often employed for other purposes than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
top-grafting of old trees. It is in common use on soft and
fleshy stocks, as cactuses, and various fleshy roots. <a href="#fig_84">Fig. 84</a> shows
a cleft-graft on cactus. The cion is held
in place with a pin or cactus spine, and it
is then bound with raffia or other cord.
Waxing is not necessary. <a href="#fig_85">Fig. 85</a> illustrates
a cleft root-graft of peony. The
cleft in the thick root is cut with a knife,
and the stock is bound up securely, usually
with wire, as cord, unless waxed, rots
off too quickly. Wax is not used, as the
graft is buried to the top bud. The peony
is grafted in summer. Dahlias are often
grafted after the same fashion, although
some operators prefer, in such fleshy subjects,
to cut out a section from the side of
the stock to receive the cion, rather than
to make a cleft. Hollyhocks, ipom&#339;as,
gloxinias and other thick-rooted plants
may be similarly treated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bark-grafting.</span>&mdash;A style of grafting
suited to large trees is shown in <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>.
The stock is not cleft, but the cions are
pushed down between the bark and wood.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 206px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 84. Cleft-graft of cactus.</div>
</div>

<p>The cion must be cut very thin so that they will not
break the bark on the stock. <a href="#fig_87">Fig. 87</a> represents a
good style of cion. It is cut to a shoulder upon either
side. Several cions can be placed in a single stub,
and as no splitting is necessary, it is a useful method
for very large limbs. It is especially useful in repairing
trees when very large branches are broken off.
A dozen or more cions may be set about the broken
portion, after it is dressed off, and a few of them
may be allowed to remain after the wound has been
healed. Bark-grafting can be performed to advantage
only when the bark peels readily. The cions should
be held in place by a tight bandage, as seen in <a href="#fig_86">Fig. 86</a>, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
wax should be applied in essentially the same manner as for
cleft-grafting. (See <a href="#fig_80">Fig. 80</a>.) This is sometimes called crown-grafting,
and is useful under certain conditions.</p>

<p>A special form of bark-grafting is sometimes
employed for covering girdles about
the base of an old tree, made by mice,
gophers or rabbits. The edges of the bark
are trimmed, and cions are cut a couple
inches longer than the width of the girdle.
These are sharpened at both ends. One
end is inserted under the bark below the
girdle and the other above it. The cions
are placed close together entirely around
the tree. This operation is said to be necessary
to keep up the connection between the
root and the top, but this is in most cases
an error. A good dressing of cow-dung,
wax or clay, held on with stout bandages, is
much better than the grafting. This method
of grafting is sometimes, but erroneously,
called inarching. A complete girdle made
during the spring or early summer will
usually heal over readily if it is well bandaged;
and in some cases even the bandage
is not necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herbaceous-grafting.</span>&mdash;In the preceding pages, the discussions
have had to do with cions which are dormant or at least
well-hardened, and with stocks which contain more or less hard
woody substance. But herbaceous shoots can be grafted with
ease. All such plants as geraniums, begonias, coleuses and
chrysanthemums can be made to bear two or more varieties
upon the same individual. Almost any style of grafting can be
employed, but the veneer, cleft and saddle-grafts are preferred.
Shoots should be chosen for stocks which are rather firm, or in
the condition for making good cuttings. The cions should be in
a similar condition, and they may be taken from the tips of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span>
branches or made of a section of a branch. The union should
be bound snugly with raffia, and the plant set in a propagating
frame, where it must be kept close for a few days.
It is not necessary, in most cases, to use wax, and
upon some tender stocks the wax is injurious.
Moss may be bound about the graft, but unless the
union is first thoroughly covered by the bandage,
roots will start into the moss and the parts will fail
to unite. The growing shoots of shrubs and trees
can also be grafted, but the operation is rarely
employed. In various coniferous trees (as pines
and spruces) the young shoots are sometimes cleft
or saddle-grafted in May, the parts being well
bandaged with waxed muslin or raffia, and shaded
with paper bags. The walnut and some other
trees which do not work readily are sometimes
treated in this manner.</p>

<p>A little known species of herbaceous-grafting is
the joining of parts of fruits. It is easily performed
upon all fleshy fruits like tomatoes, apples,
squashes and cucumbers. When the fruit is half
or more grown, one-half is cut away and a similar
half from another fruit is applied. Better results
follow if the severed side of the parent or stock fruit is hollowed
out a little, so as to let the foreign piece set into the
cavity. The edges of the epidermis of the stock are then tied up
closely against the cion by means of bass or raffia. The two
parts are securely tied together, but no wax is required. This
operation succeeds best under glass, where conditions are uniform
and winds do not blow the fruits about.</p>

<p>Even leaves may be used as stocks or cions. Any such succulent
and permanent leaves as those of the house-leeks, crassula,
and the like may have young shoots worked upon them, and
leaves which are used as cuttings can often be made to grow on
other plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seed-grafting.</span>&mdash;A novel kind of grafting has been described
in France by Pieron, which consists in using a seed as a cion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">« 91 »</a></span>
This has been used upon the grape. A seed is dropped into a
gimlet-hole made near the base of the vine while the sap is
flowing in the spring. The seed germinates, and after a
time the plantlet unites with the stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Double-grafting.</span>&mdash;Grafting upon a grafted tree is
known as double-grafting or double-working. It is employed
for the purpose of growing a variety upon an
uncongenial root or of securing a straight and vigorous
stock for a weak and poor grower. Some sorts of pears
do not unite well with the quince, and if it is desired to
secure dwarfs of these varieties, some variety which
unites readily with the quince must first be put upon it.
The Angouleme takes well to the quince, and upon
Angouleme dwarfs the Seckel and some other varieties
are often worked. The last cion is usually set
after the first one has grown one season, although both
may be set at the same time. Double-grafting for the
purpose of securing a better growth is often practiced.
The Canada Red apple, for instance, is such a poor
grower that it is often stem-worked or top-worked upon
the Northern Spy or some other strong stock. The
Winter Nelis and the Josephine de Malines pears are
often double-worked for the same reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cutting-grafting.</span>&mdash;Cuttage and graftage are combined
in various ways. Cuttings of plants which root with difficulty
are sometimes grafted upon those which root easily.
When the plants are transplanted, the following autumn or
spring, the nurse or stock can be removed, the cion having taken
root. Root-grafting with a long cion, described on a previous
page (78), is virtually a grafting of cuttings. In other cases, union
with an uncongenial stock is facilitated by allowing the cion to
project downwards beyond the point of union and to stand in
the soil or moss or a dish of water. <a href="#fig_88">Fig. 88</a> is a good illustration
of the practice. The cion extends into the soil nearly as far as
the root itself. After union has taken place, the lower part of
the cion is removed. This method can be used for some magnolias,
mulberries, birches, and many other plants of which
some kinds root with more or less difficulty. Bottle-grafting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
described in most of the books, is essentially this method, modified
by letting the end of the cion drop into a bottle of water.
Sometimes a portion of the bandage
is allowed to hang in water, to
keep the cion fresh until the parts
join.</p>

<p><b>Inarching.</b>&mdash;Inarching or grafting
by approach is the process of
grafting contiguous plants or
branches while the parts are both
attached to their own roots. When
the parts are united, one of them
is severed from its root. <a href="#fig_89">Fig. 89</a>
explains the operation. In this
case, the larger plant is designed
for the stock. When the smaller
plant has united, it is cut off just
below the union and it thenceforth
grows upon the other plant.
Limbs of contiguous trees are
sometimes grafted in this way. It
is the process employed by nature
in what is called natural grafting. Grape-vines are often inarched.
A thrifty young branch may be inarched into the
stem of a fruit upon the same tree, thus supplying the fruit
with additional food and causing it to grow larger than it might
if undisturbed.</p>

<p>To join the parts, it is only necessary to remove the barks
between the stock and cion and then tie the two together snugly.
If out-doors, the junction should be waxed over; and it is then
necessary, also, to secure the branches in such manner that the
wind cannot loosen them. The parts are sometimes joined by a
tongue, after the manner of a whip-graft, but this is rarely necessary.
Oranges and camelias were often propagated by inarching
in the old practice, but this work is now much more easily
done by the veneer-graft.</p>

<p><b>Grafting-waxes.</b>&mdash;There are great numbers of recipes for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
waxes or mastics for protecting grafts and covering wounds
upon trees. In this country the resin and beeswax waxes are
most used, although some of the
alcoholic waxes are popular in some
regions. In Europe, many clay and
pitch waxes are in common use.
For most purposes, the wax No. 1
in the following list will be found
one of the best, especially for applying
by the hand. In making the
resin and beeswax waxes, the
materials are first broken up finely
and melted together. When thoroughly
melted, the liquid is poured
into a pail or tub of cold water. It
soon becomes hard enough to handle,
and it is then pulled and worked
over until it becomes tough or
&ldquo;gets a grain,&rdquo; at which stage it
becomes the color of very light-colored
manilla paper. When wax
is applied by hand, the hands must
be well greased. Hard tallow is the best material for this purpose.
In top-grafting large trees it is well to carry a supply of
tallow when waxing by smearing the backs of the hands before
entering the tree.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>1. Common Resin and Beeswax Waxes.</i></p>

<p>1. Resin, 4 parts by weight; beeswax, 2 parts; tallow, 1 part.</p>

<p>2. Resin, 4 lbs.; beeswax, 1 lb.; tallow, 1 lb.</p>

<p>3. Resin, 6 lbs.; beeswax, 2 lbs.; linseed oil, 1 pt.</p>

<p>4. Resin, 6 lbs.; beeswax, 1 lb.; linseed oil, 1 pt.; apply hot
with a brush, one-eighth of an inch thick over all the joints.</p>

<p>5. Resin, 4 lbs.; beeswax, 1 lb.; and from half to a pint
of raw linseed oil; melt all together gradually, and turn into
water and pull. The linseed oil should be entirely free from
cotton-seed oil. For use in warm weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span></p>

<p>6. Resin, 6 parts; beeswax, 1 part; tallow, 1 part. To be
used warm, in the house.</p>

<p>7. Resin, 4 or 5 parts; beeswax, 1&frac12; to 2 parts; linseed oil,
1 to 1&frac12; parts. For out-door work.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>2. Alcoholic Waxes.</i></p>

<p>8. Lefort&rsquo;s Liquid Grafting Wax, or Alcoholic Plastic.&mdash;Best
white resin, 1 lb.; beef tallow, 1 oz.; remove from the fire and
add 8 ozs. of alcohol. Keep in closed bottles or cans.</p>

<p>9. Alcoholic Plastic with Beeswax.&mdash;Melt 6 parts white resin
with 1 part beeswax; remove from stove and partially cool by
stirring, then add gradually&mdash;with continued stirring&mdash;enough
alcohol to make the mixture, when cool, of the consistency of
porridge. In the temperature of the grafting-room it will
remain sufficiently plastic to permit applying to the cut surfaces
with the finger.</p>

<p>10. Alcoholic Plastic with Turpentine.&mdash;Best white resin,
1 lb.; beef tallow, 1 oz.; turpentine, 1 teaspoonful; add enough
alcohol (13 to 15 fluid ozs. of 95 per cent. alcohol) to make the
wax of the consistency of honey. Or, less alcohol may be
added if the wax is to be used with the fingers.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>3. French and Pitch Waxes.</i></p>

<p>11. Common French.&mdash;Pitch, &frac12; lb.; beeswax, &frac12; lb.; cow-dung,
1 lb. Boil together, melt and apply with a brush.</p>

<p>12. Common French Bandage Wax.&mdash;Equal parts of beeswax,
turpentine and resin. While warm spread on strips of
coarse cotton or strong paper.</p>

<p>13. Grafting Clay.&mdash;&#8531; cow-dung, free from straw, and &#8532;
clay, or clayey loam, with a little hair, like that used in plaster,
to prevent its cracking. Beat and temper it for two or three
days until it is thoroughly incorporated. When used it should
be of such a consistency as to be easily put on and shaped with
the hands.</p>

<p>14. Resin, 2 lbs. 12 ozs.; Burgundy pitch, 1 lb. 11 ozs. At
the same time, melt 9 ozs. of tallow; pour the latter into the
former, while both are hot, and stir the mixture thoroughly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
Then add 18 ozs. of red ochre, dropping it in gradually and stirring
the mixture at the same time.</p>

<p>15. Black pitch, 28 parts; Burgundy pitch, 28 parts; beeswax,
16 parts; grease, 14 parts; yellow ochre, 14 parts.</p>

<p>16. Black pitch, 28 lbs.; Burgundy pitch, 28 lbs.; yellow
wax, 16 lbs.; suet or tallow, 14 lbs.; sifted ashes, 14 lbs.
When used, warm sufficiently to make it liquid, without being so
hot as to injure the texture of the branches.</p>

<p>17. Melt together 1&frac14; lb. of clear resin and &frac34; lb. of white
pitch. At the same time melt &frac14; lb. of tallow. Pour the
melted tallow into the first mixture, and stir vigorously. Then
before the stuff cools add, slowly stirring meantime, &frac12; lb. of
Venetian red. This may be used warm or cold.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>4. Waxed String and Bandage.</i></p>

<p>18. Waxed String for Root-grafting.&mdash;Into a kettle of melted
wax place balls of No. 18 knitting cotton. Turn the balls frequently,
and in five minutes they will be thoroughly saturated,
when they are dried and put away for future use. This material
is strong enough, and at the same time breaks so easily as not to
injure the hands. Any of the resin and beeswax waxes may be
used. When the string is used, it should be warm enough to
stick without tying.</p>

<p>19. Waxed Cloth.&mdash;Old calico or thin muslin is rolled on
a stick and placed in melted wax. When saturated it is allowed
to cool by being unrolled on a bench. It is then cut in strips
to suit. Or the wax may be spread upon the cloth with a brush.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>5. Waxes for Wounds.</i></p>

<p>20. Any of the more adhesive grafting waxes are excellent for
dressing wounds, although most of them cleave off after the
first year. Stiff and ochreous paints are also good.</p>

<p>21. Coal-tar.&mdash;Apply a coating of coal-tar to the wound, which
has first been pared and smoothed. If the wound contains a
hole, plug it with seasoned wood.</p>

<p>22. Hoskins' Wax.&mdash;Boil pine tar slowly for three or four
hours; add &frac12; lb. of beeswax to a quart of the tar. Have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
ready some dry and finely sifted clay, and when the mixture of
tar and wax is partially cold, stir into the above named quantity
about 12 ozs. of the clay; continue the stirring until the mixture
is so stiff, and so nearly cool, that the clay will not settle. This
is soft enough in mild weather to be easily applied with a knife
or spatula.</p>

<p>23. Schæfell&rsquo;s Healing Paint.&mdash;Boil linseed oil (free from
cotton-seed oil) one hour, with an oz. of litharge to each pt. of
oil; then stir in sifted wood ashes until the paint is of the
proper consistency. Pare the bark until smooth. Paint the
wound over in dry weather, and if the wound is very large, cover
with a gunny-sack.</p>

<p>24. Tar for Bleeding in Vines.&mdash;Add to tar about 3 or 4
times its weight of powdered slate or some similar substance.
Apply with an old knife or flat stick.</p>

<p>25. Hot Iron for Bleeding in Vines.&mdash;Apply a hot iron to the
bare surface until it is charred, and then rub into the charred
surface a paste made of newly-burnt lime and grease.</p>

<p>26. Collodion for Bleeding in Vines.&mdash;It may be applied with
a feather or small brush. In some extreme cases two or three
coats will be needed, in which case allow the collodion to form
a film before applying another coat. Pharmaceutical collodion
is better than photographic.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In spring by layers under a frame, and in summer by
cuttings.</p>

<p><a name="Abies" id="Abies"></a><b>Abies</b> (Fir, Spruce). <i>Coniferæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Propagated by seeds, which are usually kept dry over
winter and sown in spring in frames or in protected borders.
Cones should be fully matured before being gathered. If
they hold the seeds tightly they should be placed in a dry
place, sometimes even in an oven, until the scales spread.
In order to obtain stocky plants, the seedlings should be
transplanted the following spring. The named varieties and
the species which do not produce sufficient seed are winter-worked
upon seedling stocks which are potted from the seed-beds
in the fall. One-year-old stocks are commonly used,
but in some cases the requisite size is not reached until the
second year. Any of the common operations of grafting
may be employed. The conifers are not difficult to graft.
The European silver fir (<i>Abies pectinata</i>) may be used as a
stock, but the common Norway spruce is now the most
popular stock for species of both Abies and Picea.</p>

<p><b>Abobra.</b> <i>Cucurbitaceæ.</i></p>

<p><b>Abutilon.</b> <i>Malvaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Sow seeds in pans, with same soil and temperature as for
cuttings. By cuttings from young wood, at almost any
season; the best time, however, is spring or fall. Insert
in pots, in a compost of equal parts peat, leaf-mould, loam
and sand, and place in a temperature of 65&deg; to 75&deg;.</p>

<p><b>Acacia.</b> <i>Leguminosæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Propagate by seeds sown as soon as ripe, in sandy peat;
about one-fourth inch deep, or a little more for large
seeds. Soak in hot water 24 hours if seeds are not fresh.
Keep temperature about 55&deg; or 60&deg; and pot off when large
enough to handle. By cuttings of the half-ripened wood,
put in with a heel, in equal parts peat and sand, covered
with pure sand. Insert the cuttings as soon as made; water,
and leave them in the shade till dry. Place under a bell-glass,
shade and water to prevent flagging. Pot off when

Water carefully.</p>

<p><a name="Acer" id="Acer"></a><b>Acer</b> (Maple). <i>Sapindaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Stocks are grown from stratified seeds, which should be
sown an inch or two deep. Some species, as <i>A. dasycarpum</i>,
come readily if seeds are simply sown as soon as ripe.
Varieties are often layered, but better plants are obtained by
grafting. The Japanese sorts are winter-worked on imported
<i>A. polymorphum</i> stocks, either by whip or veneer grafting.
Varieties of native species are worked upon common native

are essential until the young plant is established. The old
stool will soon send out lateral growths, which, in time,

<p><a name="Apple" id="Apple"></a><b>Apple</b> (<i>Pyrus Malus</i>). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Standard apple stocks are grown from seeds, and dwarf
stocks from layers. Apple seeds are either imported from
France or are obtained from pomace. The French seeds
give what are technically known as <i>crab stocks</i>, the word <i>crab</i>
being used in the sense of a wild or inferior apple. The
yearling stocks themselves are imported from France in
great numbers. It has been supposed that French crab
stocks are hardier and more vigorous than ours, but this
opinion is much less common than formerly, and the foreign
stocks are not so popular now as the domestic stocks.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The chief source of apple seeds at the present time is the
pomace from cider mills. The &ldquo;cheese&rdquo; of pomace is
broken up, and if the material is dry enough it may be run
through a large sieve to remove the coarser parts. The
seeds are then removed by washing. Various devices are in
use for washing them out. They all proceed upon the fact
that the pomace will rise in water and the seeds sink. Some
use a tub or common tank, which is tilted a little to allow the
water to flow over the side. Others employ boxes some
seven or eight feet long, four feet wide and a foot deep, the
lower end of which is only eleven inches deep to allow the
escape of the water. This box is set upon benches, and a
good stream of water is carried into it at the upper end. A
bushel or two of pomace is emptied in at a time, and it is
broken and stirred with a fork or shovel. When the seeds
are liberated they fall to the bottom and the refuse runs
over the lower end. Another box is provided with several
cleats, at intervals of about a foot, and the ends are left
open. The box is set at an angle, and the seeds are caught
behind the cleats. Seeds must not stand long in the pomace
pile, or they will be seriously injured. Nurserymen like to
secure the pomace as soon as it is taken from the press.</p>

<p class="blockquot">As soon as the seeds are collected, they should be spread
upon tables or boards, and should be frequently turned
until perfectly dry. They may then be stored in boxes in
slightly damp sand or sawdust, or in powdered charcoal and
kept in a cool and dry place until spring. Or if they are to
be sown immediately they need not be dried, but simply
mixed with enough dry sand to absorb the water so as to
make them easy to handle Seeds should not be allowed to
become hard and dry through long exposure to the air, or
they will germinate unevenly. Apple seeds procured at the
seed stores are often worthless because of this neglect. Very
dry seeds can sometimes be grown, however, by subjecting
them to repeated soakings and then sprouting in a gentle hot-bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
or mild forcing-house. Change the water on the seeds
every day, and at the end of a week or ten days mix with
sand and place in a thin layer in the hot-bed. Stir frequently
to prevent molding. When the seeds begin to sprout, sow
them in the open ground. This operation, which is sometimes
called <i>pipping</i>, may be performed in a small way by
the kitchen stove. Seeds are sometimes &ldquo;pipped&rdquo; between
moist blankets. (See also <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>.)</p>

<p class="blockquot">When sowing is done in the fall, the seeds may be sown in
the pomace. This entails extra labor in sowing, but it saves
the labor of washing. This practice gives good results if
the pomace is finely broken, and it is now common among
nurserymen.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In loose and well-drained soils, sowing is undoubtedly best
performed in the fall, just as early as the seeds are ready.
But upon land which holds much water, and which heaves
with frost or contains much clay, spring sowing is preferable.
In spring, the seeds should be sown just as soon as the ground
can be worked.</p>

<p class="blockquot">If the stocks are to be cultivated with a horse, the rows
should be three or three and a half feet apart. Some growers
sow in narrow drills and some in broad ones. The broad
drills are usually six to ten inches wide. The earth is
removed to the depth of two or three inches, if it is loose and
in good condition, the seed is scattered thinly on the surface
and the earth hoed back over them. If the ground is likely
to bake, the seeds should not be sown so deep; and it is
always well, in such cases, to apply some very light and
clean mulch. The plants should be well cultivated during
the season, and they should attain a height of six to twelve
inches or more the first year. If the plants come thickly,
they must be thinned out.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In the fall of the first year the seedlings should be large
enough to be dug and sold to general nurserymen. Sometimes
the poorest plants are allowed to stand another year,
but they are usually so scattering that they do not pay for the
use of the land, and they should be transplanted the same
as the larger stock, or the weakest ones may be thrown away.
The stocks are dug with a plow or tree-digger and heeled-in
closely, so that the leaves &ldquo;sweat&rdquo; and fall off. The plants
are then stored in sand, moss or sawdust in a cellar. Before
they are shipped the tops are cut off near the crown, usually
with a hatchet on a block. The stocks are then graded into
budding and grafting sizes. The general nurserymen buy
these stocks in fall or early winter. Those which are root-grafted
are worked during late winter, but those intended for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">« 118 »</a></span>
budding, or which must be grown another season before
they attain sufficient size for working, are &ldquo;dressed&rdquo; (See
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>) and heeled-in; in the spring they are set in
nursery rows, from a foot to eighteen inches apart in the
row. The nurseryman reckons the age of his tree from the
time the seedling is transplanted, rather than from the time
the seed was sown.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Seedling raising is usually conducted by men who make it
a business and who supply the general nurserymen of the
country. It is largely practiced at the west, where the deep
and strong soils produce a rapid growth. The yearling trees
are graded by the western growers into about four lots:
&ldquo;Extras,&rdquo; or those at least one-fourth inch in diameter at the
crown and having twelve inches of both top and root; these
are used mostly as budding stocks the next season, &ldquo;Commons,&rdquo;
those between three-sixteenths and one-fourth inch
at the crown and having eight inches of root; these are used
for immediate root-grafting. &ldquo;Second-class,&rdquo; those from
two to three-sixteenths inch at the crown, and &ldquo;third-class,&rdquo;
or all those under two-sixteenths. The last two classes must
be grown in the field for one or two seasons before they can
be worked.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Dwarf stocks are mostly obtained from mound-layering.
The common stock for dwarfing is the Paradise apple, a
dwarf variety of the common apple species (<i>Pyrus Malus</i>).
This variety rarely attains a height of more than four feet.
A larger or freer stock is the Doucin, also a variety of <i>Pyrus
Malus</i>, which will produce an engrafted tree intermediate in
size between that given by the Paradise and free or common
stocks. This is little used in this country. To obtain stools
for mound-layering, the tree, when well established, is cut
off within four or six inches of the ground in spring, and during
the summer several shoots or sprouts will arise. The next
year the stool is covered by a mound, and by autumn the layers
are ready to take off. Sometimes, when stocks are rare,
mound-layering is performed during the first summer, before
the young shoots have hardened, but good stocks are not obtained
by this method. Common green layering is sometimes
practiced the first year, but it is not in favor. The dwarf
stocks, in common with all apple stocks, may be propagated
by root-cuttings and by hard-wood cuttings.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Apple stocks are either grafted or budded. Root-grafting
is the most common, especially at the west where long scions
are used in order to secure own-rooted trees. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>.)
Budding is gaining in favor eastward and southward;
it is performed during August and early September in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">« 119 »</a></span>
northern states, or it may be begun on strong stocks in July
by using buds which have been kept on ice. Stocks should
be strong enough to be budded the same year they are transplanted,
but the operation is sometimes deferred until the
second summer. Stocks which cannot be worked until the
second year are unprofitable, especially on valuable land.
For root-grafting, strong one-year-old roots are best, but
two-year-olds are often used.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In common practice, the root is cut into two or three
pieces of two to three inches each, but stronger trees are
obtained, at least the first year or two, by using the whole
root and grafting upon the crown. The lowest piece is
usually small and weak and is generally discarded.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The apple is easily top-grafted and top-budded. (See
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Apple Berry.</b> See <a href="#Billardiera">Billardiera</a>.</p>

<p><b>Apricot</b> (<i>Prunus Armeniaca</i>). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The apricot thrives upon a variety of stocks. Apricot
stocks are used in apricot-growing regions, especially for
deep and rich well-drained soils. The pits grow readily if
given the same treatment as that detailed for the peach
(which see). The stocks are also handled in the same manner
as peach-stocks. Apricots upon apricot roots are not
largely grown outside of California, in this country. Apricot
stocks can be grown from root-cuttings the same as cherries
and other stone-fruits.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The apricot does well upon the peach, especially on light
soils. In the warmer parts of the country peach is much used.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Plum stocks are commonly used at the north, especially if
the trees are to be planted in moist or heavy soils. The
common plum is generally used, but some of the native
plum stocks are now coming into favor, especially in trying
climates. The Russian apricots, which are a hardy race of
<i>Prunus Armeniaca</i>, are grown in colder climates than the
common varieties, and they therefore demand hardy stocks.
Any of the native plums make good stocks, but the Marianna
is now coming into especial prominence. The myrobolan
plum can be used for all apricots, but it is not popular, particularly
in severe climates.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The almond, both hard and soft-shelled, is sometimes used
for the apricot, but the union is likely to be imperfect and it
is not recommended. Almond-rooted trees are best adapted
to light soils.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Varieties of apricots are usually budded, in the same way
as the peach, although they may be side-grafted at the crown
in the nursery row.</p>

securing as many roots as possible to each division. Any
rootless pieces should be placed in heat shortly after removal;
this hastens the formation of roots and excites top
growth. Arisæmas are treated in the same way.</p>

<p><b>Asparagus.</b> <i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The common kitchen garden asparagus is best propagated
by means of seeds. These are sown in spring as soon as the
ground can be worked, usually in rows a foot or two apart.
Thin the young plants to two or three inches apart in the
row and give good culture, and the plants can be set in the
field the following spring, and they will give a fair crop after
growing there two seasons. Small growers nearly always
buy plants of nurserymen. Old asparagus crowns can be
divided, but seeds give better plants.</p>

<p>The ornamental species of asparagus are propagated by
seeds when they are obtainable; otherwise, by division.</p>

In early autumn carefully transplant to a cool shady border.
Also by divisions. Where a stock of old plants exists,
layer their long slender branches any time after flowering,
and cover with a mixture of sand and leaf soil; they
will then root freely and establish themselves in time for

well-drained pots, filled with sandy soil, well watered previous
to sowing. Cover lightly with coarse sand, place a
pane of glass over the pot, and place the latter in a hand-glass.
By offsets, which should be removed when top-dressed,
as they are more likely to root. Arrange about
four offsets around the sides of well-drained three-inch pots,
filled with sandy soil, place under a bell-glass or in a close
hand-light, water very sparingly so as to prevent them
damping off. After becoming established, admit air, and pot
off singly.</p>

<p><b>Azalea.</b> <i>Ericaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Increased by seeds, sown as soon as ripe, or early the following
spring, in a large shallow frame containing from two
to three inches of peat, over which more peat must be spread
by means of a fine sieve; do not cover, but water thoroughly.
When the seedlings begin to appear they should have air,
shade, and a daily sprinkling of water; transplant in autumn
in boxes of peat and coarse sand, water, shade and keep close
until growth commences. Grafting is largely practiced to
increase the stock of named varieties or choice seedlings, the
stock most employed being <i>A. pontica</i> for hardy sorts, and
some strong-growing variety of <i>A. Indica</i>, like &ldquo;Ph&#339;nicia,&rdquo;
for tender ones. Layering in spring, enclosing the part buried
with moss, is also practiced; but the layer must be left
two years before separating. Cuttings of the last year&rsquo;s
wood two or three inches long, taken with a heel, root readily
in sand; about the end of summer is the best time. When
placed outside they should be covered with a hand-light for
about two months, and at the end of that time air should be
given freely.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Edible bananas rarely produce seeds. The young plants
are obtained from suckers, which spring from the main root-stock.
These suckers are transplanted when two or three
feet high. These plants themselves do not produce so good
crops as the suckers which arise from them, and are not
transplanted. Two or three suckers are sufficient for a plant
at a time; what others arise should be transplanted or destroyed.
The suckers should be set deep, as low as two feet
for best results. In fifteen or eighteen months the plants
will bloom, if they have had good care. The stem bears
fruit but once, but new stems arise to take its place.</p>

<p><b>Begonia.</b> <i>Begoniaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Increased by seeds, well-ripened before they are gathered,
and kept very dry until sown. For the successful raising of
begonias, it is necessary to sow the seed in pans or pots of
well-drained, light, sandy soil, which should be well watered
before the seeds are sown. The seeds should not be covered
with soil, or they will fail to germinate. Place a pane of
glass over the pans, and set in a warm house or frame,
where a temperature of about 65&deg; can be maintained, and
shade from the sun. As soon as the plants are large enough
they should be pricked off into pans of light leaf-mould soil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">« 133 »</a></span>
in which they may remain until large enough to be placed
singly in pots. By divisions of the rhizomes. Also increased
by cuttings, which strike freely in pots of sand and leaf-mould,
and placed on a bottom heat of about 70&deg;. Where
large quantities are required, a bed of cocoanut fiber in a stove
or propagating-frame may be used, and in this the cuttings may
be planted, and remain until well-rooted. Leaf cuttings succeed
best when laid on sand or cocoanut fiber, and shaded
from bright sunlight. Select old, well-matured leaves, and
make an incision with a sharp knife across the principal
nerves, on the under side. They should then be placed on
the sand or fiber, and held down by means of a few pieces
of crock. Under this treatment bulbils will form on the
lower ends of the nerves of each section of the leaf, and
these, when large enough, may be removed from the bed and
potted. Fan-shaped pieces of leaves are often used. Leaf
cuttings of begonia are described and figure in <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a>.
Species like <i>B. diversifolia</i>, etc., may be propagated by the
bulblets which form in the axils of the leaves. Tuberous begonias
are best propagated by seeds, as described above, but
stem-cuttings can be used with fair success, if they are cut just
below a joint.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Propagated by suckers which are taken from the base of the

The best method to adopt is as follows: Take the sucker in
the hand and gently twist it off the stem; next, trim the base
by the removal of a few of the lower leaves, and then insert
each sucker separately in a small pot, in sharp soil. A bottom
heat of about 80&deg; will greatly facilitate new root growth;
failing this, they will root freely in the temperature of a
stove, if placed in a shaded position for two or three weeks,
after which they will bear increased light and sunshine during
the latter part of the day.</p>

latter is the better method.</p>

<p><a name="Blackberry" id="Blackberry"></a><b>Blackberry</b> (<i>Rubus villosus</i> and vars.). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">New varieties are obtained from seeds, which may be sown
as soon as they are cleaned from the ripe fruit, or which may
be stratified until the next spring. If the soil is in prime condition,
fall sowing is preferable.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Varieties are multiplied by suckers and by root-cuttings.
The suckers spring up freely about the old plants, especially
if the roots are broken by the cultivator; but they have few
fibrous roots and are inferior. The best plants are obtained
from root-cuttings. Roots from one-fourth to three-eighths
inch in diameter are selected for this purpose. The roots
are dug in the fall, cut into pieces an inch or two long, and
stored until early spring. They may be buried in boxes of
sand after the manner of stratified seeds, or stored in a cool
cellar; callusing proceeds most rapidly in a cellar. The
pieces are planted horizontally an inch or two deep, in loose,
rich soil. It is best to put them in a frame and give them
slight bottom heat, although they will grow if planted in the
open in April or May, but the plants will make much less
growth the first season. Some varieties do not strike quickly
without bottom heat. When the variety is scarce, shorter
and slenderer pieces of root may be used, but these demand
bottom heat. The heat in the frames is usually supplied by
manure, or the heat of the sun under the glass may be sufficient.
In these frames the cuttings can be started in the
north late in March, or some six or eight weeks before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">« 137 »</a></span>
plants can be set out-doors without protection. When the
weather has become somewhat settled, the plants may be
planted out, and by fall they will be two to three feet high.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Propagated by seeds sown as soon as ripe, in any light,
well-drained soil. They can be increased by suckers and
divisions; by layers of young or old wood, made in autumn
or early spring; by cuttings made of the young shoots, from
four to six inches in length, in a sandy place in spring or

<p class="blockquot">Propagation by seeds is not often adopted, as it is a very
slow method. The seeds should be sown in very sandy soil,
and placed in a semi-shady position until germination commences,
when they may be exposed and very carefully
watered. Usually propagated by cuttings or offsets, which
should be made with a sharp cut, and laid upon a sunny
shelf or on dry sand until the wound is healed and roots emitted,
when they should be potted in sandy soil. Place with
the others, and keep syringed. Grafting is resorted to with
weak kinds, which will not grow freely except upon the stock
of a stronger species; and by this means, also, such kinds
can be kept from the damp soil, which frequently causes decay.
The stocks usually employed are those of <i>Cereus tortuosus</i>,
<i>C. peruvianus</i>, <i>Pereskia aculeata</i>, etc., according to the
species intended for working; they readily unite with each
other. If the scion and stock are both slender, cleft-grafting
should be adopted; if both are broad it is best to make
horizontal sections, placing them together and securing in
proper position by tying with matting, but not too tightly, or
the surface may be injured.</p>

than ordinary care, will check their growth or result in loss.</p>

<p><b>Calanthe.</b> <i>Orchideæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">As a rule, the natural annual increase in the number of
pseudo-bulbs meets the requirements of most cultivators.
Where a quick propagation is desired, it may be performed
by dividing the pseudo-bulbs transversely; after allowing
the raw surface to callus, the upper part should be set on
moist sand, and several buds will form around the base.
The bottom portion may be used in the ordinary way.
Another plan is to divide the pseudo-bulbs lengthwise into
two or more pieces. (See under <a href="#Orchids">Orchids</a>.)</p>

August on pans of light, sandy soil, which should be soaked
with water before sowing. Care must be taken to make the
surface of the soil level, and also to sow the seed as evenly
as possible. It is better not to cover with soil, but a sheet
of glass should be laid over the pan, which must be placed
in a shady part of the greenhouse or cold-frame until the
young plants show the first leaf. The glass can then be
gradually removed. The shrubby kinds, by seeds and by cuttings
in August. Place in a cold-frame facing the north, in

<p><b>Cherry</b> (<i>Prunus Avium and P. Cerasus</i>). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Cherry stocks are commonly grown from seeds. If the
ground is in readiness and is in proper condition, the seeds
may be planted in fall, or even as soon as they are ripe. If
stored until spring, they must be stratified and kept very
cool to prevent germination, and they should be sown at the
earliest possible moment. They do not need to be cracked
by hand. Care must be taken that cherry pits do not become
hard and dry. This precaution is more important with
cherries than with peaches and plums. At the close of the
first season the seedlings will be a foot or foot and a half
high, large enough to transplant into nursery rows after the
manner of apples, where they are budded the following season.
In warm climates the pits are sometimes cracked as
soon as they are gathered, and the &ldquo;meats&rdquo; planted immediately.
They will then make stocks fit for grafting the following
winter, or for transplanting and budding the following
summer. Cherry seeds must never be allowed to become
so dry that the meat is hard and brittle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">« 159 »</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Cherries, in common with other stone fruits, grow readily
from root-cuttings, in the same manner as blackberries.
They do better if started over a gentle heat.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Mazzard cherry is the stock upon which cherries are
nearly always worked. It is simply a hardy and vigorous
variety, with inferior fruit, of the common sweet cherry
(<i>Prunus Avium</i>). Seeds of this are readily procured in this
country. All varieties of cherries are worked readily upon
it. The Mahaleb cherry is used as a stock for nearly all varieties
when dwarf trees are desired. This is a distinct species,
<i>Prunus Mahaleb</i>. The seeds or stocks are usually imported.
This stock is adapted to heavy clay soils, while the
Mazzard is not. The Mahaleb is not generally used in this
country.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Morello (<i>Prunus Cerasus</i>) stocks will no doubt prove to be
valuable in the northwest, where great hardiness is demanded.
Seedlings do not sprout or sucker badly, but the natural
suckers, which are sometimes used for stocks, are likely to
be more troublesome in this respect. If strong-growing tops
are worked on Morello stocks, however, there is usually little
annoyance from suckering.</p>

<p class="blockquot">It is probable that some of the native American cherries
can be used as stocks. The common wild red, pin or bird
cherry (<i>Prunus Pennsylvanica</i>) has already been used to some
extent. The sweet and sour cherries unite readily with it,
and bear very early. It is yet to be determined how long
the trees will persist, but there are trees known which are
sixteen or eighteen years old, and which are still healthy and
vigorous. The dwarf or sand cherry (<i>Prunus pumila</i>), especially
the western form of it, gives promise as a dwarf stock.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cherry stocks are worked both by budding and grafting.
Budding is the common method. The stocks should be fit
to work the season they are transplanted, or in the second
summer from seed. Such as are too small for working then
may be allowed to stand until the following year.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In the west, where great hardiness is required, the varieties
are crown-grafted upon Mazzard stocks in winter. Yearling
stocks are used, and the cions are from six to ten inches
long. When planted, only the top bud should be left above
ground. The cion strikes roots, and own-rooted trees are
obtained.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The ornamental cherries are worked upon the same stocks
as the fruit-bearing sorts. Mazzard is commonly used for
all species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">« 160 »</a></span></p>

<p><b>Chervil</b> (<i>Chærophyllum bulbosum</i> and <i>Scandix Cerefolium</i>). <i>Umbelliferæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds, sown much the same as celery seeds, but the plants
are usually allowed to stand where sown. Seed is often
sown in autumn.</p>

<p><b>Chestnut</b> (<i>Castanea sativa</i> and var. <i>Americana</i>, and <i>C. Japonica</i>).
<i>Cupuliferæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Chestnut stocks are grown from seeds. Difficulty is sometimes
experienced in keeping the seeds, as they lose their
vitality if dried too hard, and are likely to become mouldy
if allowed to remain moist. The surest way is to allow the
nuts to become well dried off or &ldquo;seasoned&rdquo; in the fall, and
then stratify them in a box with three or four times as much
sand as chestnuts, and bury the box a foot or two deep in
a warm soil until spring. They do not always keep well if
stored or stratified in a cellar. Fall planting exposes the
nuts to squirrels and mice. American stocks are probably
better than European.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The stocks are worked by whip-grafting above ground, the
wound being well tied and protected by waxed cloth. Care
should be taken to have the stock and cion about the same
size, in order to secure a good union. Crown-grafting, root-grafting
and budding have not been very successful in this
country upon the chestnut. The cions should be cut early,
before they begin to swell, and kept dormant until the stock
begins to push into leaf. Only vigorous stocks should be
grafted. The best results are obtained when the stocks have
recovered from transplanting, or when they are from three
to five years old. The working of chestnut stocks is far from
satisfactory in a commercial way. The union is imperfect
in many varieties, and usually no more than half the grafts
take well.</p>

by suckers or layers. Stools kept for layering must be allowed
to make more growth than those used for suckers. Free
growth must be encouraged for a year or more, and, any suitable
time in winter, the shoots should be bent to the ground,
pegged firmly, and covered to the depth of three inches with
earth. They will be well-rooted by the following autumn,
and may then be removed and planted out permanently.</p>

<p><a name="Cranberry" id="Cranberry"></a><b>Cranberry</b> (<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i>). <i>Ericaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The cultivated cranberry is propagated entirely by cuttings.
These are made from vigorous young runners, from
six to ten inches in length, and they are thrust obliquely into
the soil until only an inch or two of the tip projects. Some
blunt instrument, as a stick, is commonly used to force them
into the sand of cranberry bogs. Planting is done in the
spring, and the cuttings are taken just previous to the operation.
If cranberry seedlings are desired, the seeds should be
sown in flats of peaty earth, which are stored until spring in
some protected place, in the manner of stratification boxes.
The seeds should be covered lightly, preferably with fine
moss. The plants are allowed to grow the first year in the
box.</p>

new corms, or cormels, are also formed by the side of the
old corms. These old corms die away annually. Some species
increase much more rapidly than others.</p>

<p><b>Currant</b> (<i>Ribes rubrum</i>, <i>R. nigrum</i> and <i>R. aureum</i>). <i>Saxifrageæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">New varieties are grown from seeds, which may be sown in
the fall or stratified until spring. Varieties are nearly always
multiplied by hard-wood cuttings (<a href="#fig_49">Fig. 49</a>). The cuttings
may be taken in spring and placed directly in the ground, but
better results are obtained by taking them in the fall or late
summer. Many nurserymen prefer to take them in August,
strip off the leaves, and bury them in bunches with the butts
up. They may remain in this condition or in a cellar all
winter, or they may be planted in the fall. Currant cuttings
strike readily, however, under any method. Some growers
cut out the buds which come below the surface of the ground
to prevent suckering, but this is not generally practiced; the
suckers are cut off when the cuttings are removed from the
cutting bed, either to be sold or to be transplanted into nursery
rows. Green-layering is sometimes practiced with rare
sorts, or single eyes may be used, as in grapes. Tip-layering,
as in the black raspberry, may also be employed. (See
<a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>.) Weak or low sorts are sometimes grafted upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span>

placed under a bell-glass in heat, or in a close frame,
where they will root readily. If gradually hardened, potted

<p><b>Dahlia.</b> <i>Compositæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Single varieties, and sometimes the doubles, are grown
from seeds. The roots may be broken apart after the crowns
have started in spring, and each part grown separately. The
roots may be started into growth in heat late in winter, and
the young sprouts may be removed and handled as ordinary
cuttings as fast as they form. Or rare sorts may be increased
during summer by cuttings from the growing tips. Cions
made of the growing tips may be grafted into the roots by a
cleft or side graft. This method is oftenest employed for
the purpose of preserving over winter rare sorts which it is
feared may be lost. The grafts are kept growing slowly during
winter, and cuttings may be taken from them. Cuttings
should always have a bud or buds at the base, and in propagation
by division there must be a piece of the crown attached
to the root.</p>

<p><a name="Daphne" id="Daphne"></a><b>Daphne.</b> <i>Thymelæaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds. For layers, remove the soil in spring to a depth
of two or three inches about the plant, and fill with fine
compost to within two inches of the tops of the shoots. The
next spring, carefully wash away the compost, and plant the
small white buds in pots of fine soil. Place in a cool frame.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cuttings should be made of matured shoots or side growths
in autumn; insert thinly in well-drained pots of peaty soil,
and cover with a bell-glass. If kept in a cool house in winter
they will callus, and may, early in spring, be introduced
to gentle heat, to encourage growth and the emission of roots.
Pot the young plants singly, and grow on in a close but not
high temperature, and afterwards harden and keep quite
cool during the following autumn and winter, in order to
thoroughly ripen the wood. Grafted specimens may be
treated in a similar way. <i>D. odora</i> is propagated by ripened
cuttings in a cool house, in sand. Sometimes the old wood
can be used. The time is determined by the fitness of the
wood.</p>

<p><b>Darlingtonia.</b> <i>Sarraceniaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Increased by seeds and by dividing the plants. Seeds may
be sown on the surface of well-prepared fibrous soil, and
then covered with dead sphagnum moss, rubbed through a
sieve. Give shade.</p>

<p><b>Darwinia.</b> <i>Myrtaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Increased by cuttings of the young roots. Place in a
cold-frame.</p>

<p><b>Dasylirion.</b> <i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Increased by seeds, suckers and cuttings.</p>

<p><a name="Date" id="Date"></a><b>Date</b> (<i>Ph&#339;nix dactylifera</i>). <i>Palmæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The seeds from commercial dates grow readily, and without
the intervention of stratification. Special varieties are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">« 175 »</a></span>
propagated by a sort of cutting, made by removing and rooting
the sprouts which appear about the base of the tree.
These root readily if taken off green and liberally supplied
with water. They often begin to bear in five or six years.</p>

<p><b>Date Palm.</b> See <a href="#Phoenix">Ph&#339;nix</a>.</p>

<p><b>Datisca.</b> <i>Datisceæ.</i></p>

<p><a name="Datura" id="Datura"></a><b>Datura</b>, including Brugmansia, Ceratocaulis and Stramonium.
<i>Solanaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The annual species are propagated by seeds, which are
started under cover in the north. The perennials are readily
grown from cuttings in mild heat. Heeled shoots are usually
preferred.</p>

<p><b>Daubenya.</b> <i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p><a name="Delphinium" id="Delphinium"></a><b>Delphinium</b> (Larkspur). <i>Ranunculaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds may be sown out-doors in a warm border in spring,
or in pans, to be placed either in frames or outside. The
old plants of perennial sorts may be cut down after flowering,
when young growths will proceed from the base, and the
whole may be lifted and carefully divided. Cuttings of the
young shoots, taken in autumn or spring, will root freely if
potted singly and placed in a cold-frame. They will flower
the following season at the same time as the divisions.</p>

<p><b>Dendrobium.</b> <i>Orchideæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The methods of propagating these plants have already
been mentioned. Where a rapid increase of a new or special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span>
variety is required, the pseudo-bulbs that are more than
one year old should be cut into lengths, and fastened on orchid
rafts, with a layer of sphagnum beneath them. Suspend
them in a hot, moist house, if possible, over a water-tank.
The advantage of this method is that the young plants
do not need shifting after they commence rooting on their
own account. The section to which <i>D. aggregatum</i>, <i>D. Jenkinsii</i>,
<i>D. densiflorum</i> and <i>D. thyrsiflorum</i> belong, are best
propagated by division. (See under <a href="#Orchids">Orchids</a>.)</p>

<p class="blockquot">Commercially, the species are mostly propagated by green
hardened cuttings in summer, under a frame. Hard-wooded
cuttings may be taken in autumn, and be treated in about
the same manner as currant cuttings (see <a href="#Page_58">page 58</a>). The
deutzias are also propagated by divisions and layers. Some
of the dwarf sorts are sometimes forced, to make cuttings
for winter use.</p>

strong bottom heat, a close frame, and the water should be
applied in a spray upon the foliage. Cuttings are sometimes
grafted upon pieces of roots. It is regarded as a difficult

<p><a id="Ferns"></a><b>Ferns.</b> <i>Filices.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Where division is possible, it is the easiest and most economical
method of propagation, and should be practiced just
before the plant starts into growth. The spores can be sown
in February and March, or earlier, under glass in a warm
propagating pit. Partly fill a suitable sized pot or pan with
coarse peat, giving plenty of drainage; make the surface
level, and on this place three-quarter inch cubes of well-seasoned
peat which is rather dry, watering the whole and
scattering on the spores evenly. Cover with a pane of glass,
and place in a partial shade. While the process which corresponds
to germination is going on, great care must be given
to the water supply. This is sometimes done by placing the
pots or pans in a saucer, from which they can suck the water
up. Overhead watering may be used, and often is, but will
sometimes introduce worms and the like.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The young plants should be pricked out when the true leaf
appears, and they are large enough to handle. The same
careful treatment should be continued until they are established
in pots.</p>

<p class="blockquot">There is not much difficulty in getting the young plants,
if fresh spores are obtainable, but there is a good deal of
trouble in handling the seedlings, and establishing them in
their growing quarters.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Most ferns are readily propagated by means of spores, as
directed above and on <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>. Some species rarely produce
spores in cultivation, however, and in other cases, as in some
tree ferns, it is almost impossible to rear the young plants after
the spores have germinated. In all such cases, recourse must
be had to separation, division or layerage. There are some
species, as <i>Asplenium bulbiferum</i>, <i>Cystopteris bulbifera</i> and
others, which bear small bulblets or detachable buds on their
fronds. These buds often vegetate while still attached to the
frond. They may be removed either before or after showing
signs of vegetation, and set in pots in a close propagating
frame, or under a bell-glass. Ferns which make broad
crowns may be divided, and this is the common mode with
many species. Some species produce creeping root-stocks,
which emit roots if pegged down into a pot of soil or on a block
of peat. Several plants can often be produced from such a
layer. All these operations are best performed in late winter,
before the new growth begins. The tree ferns are rarely
propagated to any extent in cultivation, but young plants are
imported from their native countries.</p>

<p><b>Ficus.</b> <i>Urticaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The greenhouse species are propagated by layers and cuttings.
The cuttings are handled in a close frame, and a leaf
or two is usually left on them. For <i>Ficus Carica</i>, see Fig.
Propagation by seeds is sometimes used in the edible figs,
but is not easy with the ornamental sorts. <i>F. elastica</i>, <i>F.
Indica</i>, etc., are increased by cuttings, planted in sand or
sandy soil, and placed in good bottom heat, in a frame under
glass. The large cuttings should be staked, and care must
be taken to remove the milky juice before planting. Any
winter month is good, before growth begins. Last season&rsquo;s
wood should be used.</p>

<p><b>Fig</b> (<i>Ficus Carica</i>). <i>Urticaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Figs grow readily from the plump seeds in the commercial
fruit. Wash out the seeds, and those that sink may be sown
in a frame. The young plants will appear in three or four
weeks. In from three to five years the plants will begin to
bear. New varieties are obtained in this way.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Varieties of the fig are multiplied with ease by layers,
suckers and cuttings. Make cuttings of mature wood in autumn,
cutting just below a bud. Scarce varieties may be
multiplied by single eye cuttings. Fig cuttings are handled
in the same way as grape cuttings. Some prefer, however,
to place the cuttings where the tree is to stand. A well-grown
plant will bear at two or three years of age.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The fig is readily budded and grafted, but these methods
are seldom employed, because the plant is so easily multiplied
by cuttings. Shield, ring or tubular buddings are employed.
Various methods of grafting are adapted to it, and
cleft-grafting is usually employed on old plants.</p>

Cuttings six to eight inches long of the mature wood, inserted

taken in August or September and stored during winter, in
the same way as currant cuttings. Single eye cuttings may
be used for rare kinds. Stronger plants are usually obtained
by layers, and the English varieties are nearly always layered
in this country. Mound-layering is usually employed,
the English varieties being allowed to remain in layerage two
years, but the American varieties only one (<a href="#fig_21">Fig. 21</a>). Layered
plants are usually set in nursery rows for a year after removal
from the stools. Green-layering during summer is sometimes
practiced for new or rare varieties. Strong plants may also
be procured by tip-layering, as in the black raspberry (see
p. 33). If it is desired to train the weaker gooseberries in
tree form, they may be grafted upon the stronger-growing
varieties.</p>

<p><a name="Grape" id="Grape"></a><b>Grape</b> (<i>Vitis</i>, several species). <i>Vitaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Grape seedlings are very easily grown. If the ground is
fit and there is no danger from vermin, the seeds may be
sown in the fall, but they are usually stratified and sown in
spring. They come readily if sown out-doors, but some prefer
to force them under glass with a mild bottom heat.
Seedlings do not &ldquo;come true,&rdquo; and they are therefore grown
only for the purpose of obtaining new sorts.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The grape is very readily multiplied by layers, either of
the ripe or green-wood. The ripe wood or canes may be
layered either in fall or spring, but spring is usually chosen.
The cane is simply covered up two or three inches deep, and
nearly every bud will produce a plant. In August or September
the layer should be lifted and cut up into plants.
Better plants are obtained if only the strongest canes are
used and only a part of the buds on each are allowed to
grow. The cane is usually cut back to four or five buds, or
if very strong plants are desired only one bud is left on each
layer. Canes of the previous year, those recently matured,
are preferred, although wood two or three years old may be
used, but in this case it is usually necessary to cut or otherwise
wound the joint in order to induce the formation of
roots. Vines or stools grown for the production of layers
should be cut back severely in fall or winter, to induce a vigorous
growth of canes the following season. These canes
are then layered the succeeding fall or spring. Only a part of
the canes are layered from any stool, a part being allowed to
grow for cutting back the next fall in order to get another
crop of canes. In some varieties which do not strike readily
from cuttings, layering is considerably practiced by nurserymen.
The Delaware is often grown in this way. Extra
strong layers can be secured by layering in pots. A large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">« 196 »</a></span>
pot, filled with rich soil, is plunged beneath the layer. In
this manner a layer may be rooted and separated even while
carrying fruit. Layering in pots is employed only in special
cases.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Green-layering is sometimes practiced upon new and scarce
varieties, but strong plants are not obtained unless they are
well handled by forceful culture after they are separated.
The growing cane is layered in mid-summer, usually by
serpentine layering.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cuttings are usually employed by nurserymen to propagate
the grape. These are made in many fashions. In all
ordinary cases hard-wood cuttings are made from the ripened
canes in autumn or winter when the vines are pruned. It is
advisable to take the cuttings before the canes have been
exposed to great cold. Select only those canes which are
well-matured, solid and rather short-jointed. In common
practice, the cuttings are cut into two-bud length, the lower
cut being made close to the bud. The cuttings will range
from six to ten inches in length. Some prefer three-bud
cuttings (<a href="#fig_43">Fig. 43</a>), but unless the cane is very short-jointed
such cuttings are too long to be planted and handled economically.
Three-bud cuttings usually give stronger plants the
first season because roots start from both joints as a rule.
Very strong plants are obtained from mallet cuttings (<a href="#fig_45">Fig. 45</a>),
but as only one such cutting can be made from a cane,
unless the cane bears very strong branches, they are not
much used. Various methods of peeling, slitting and slicing
cuttings are recommended, in order to extend the callusing
process but they are not used in common or commercial
practice. The cuttings are tied in bundles of 50 or 100, and
stored in sand, moss, or sawdust in a cellar, until spring,
when they are planted in rows in the open. Some varieties,
of which the Delaware is an example, do not strike
readily from cuttings. Some growers start common cuttings
of these under glass in spring. Others bury the bundles of
cuttings in a warm exposure in the fall, with the butt ends up
and about level with the surface of the ground. This
affords bottom heat to the butts and induces callusing. At
the approach of cold weather the cuttings are removed to a
cellar, or are heavily mulched and allowed to remain where
buried. Storing is safer. Some growers obtain the same
results by burying upside down in a cellar. These slow-rooting
sorts often start well if they are simply kept in a
warm cellar&mdash;but where the buds will not swell&mdash;all winter,
as the callusing is then hastened. At the end of the first
season the plants may be transplanted. The plants are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">« 197 »</a></span>
often sold at this age, but buyers usually prefer two-year-old
plants.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Single bud or &ldquo;eye&rdquo; cuttings are largely used for the
newer and rarer varieties. These are cut from the canes in
the fall, the same as long cuttings, and are stored in boxes of
sand or moss. A month before the weather becomes settled,
these boxes may be taken into a house or greenhouse, or put
in a mild hot-bed, to induce the formation of the callus.
They may then be planted out-doors, and a fair proportion of
most varieties may be expected to grow. The best and commonest
way of handling eyes, however, is to start them
under glass. They are planted horizontally or nearly so and
about an inch deep in sand or sandy earth in a cool greenhouse
in late winter&mdash;in February in the northern states&mdash;and
in about six weeks the plants will be large enough to pot
off or to transplant into cold-frames or a cool house. If
only a few plants are to be grown they may be started in
pots. When the weather is thoroughly settled, they are
transferred to nursery rows, and by fall they will make fine
plants. There are various ways recommended for the cutting
of these eyes&mdash;as cutting the ends obliquely up or
down, shaving off the bark below the bud, and so on&mdash;but
the advantages of these fashions are imaginary. A good
eye-cutting is shown in <a href="#fig_50">Fig. 50</a>. The foreign grapes are
propagated by eyes in the north.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Soft cuttings are sometimes used to multiply new kinds.
These may be taken in summer from the growing canes, but
the plants are usually forced during winter for the purpose
of giving extra wood. Cuttings are taken off as fast as buds
form during the winter, and they are forced in close frames
with a good bottom heat. The cuttings may comprise two
buds, with the leaf at the upper one allowed to remain,
or they may bear but a single eye, in which case the leaf, or
the most of it, is left on. This rapid multiplication from
small, soft wood usually gives poor plants; but strong plants
may be obtained by allowing the wood to become well
hardened before it is used. Soft cuttings will root in two or
three weeks under good treatment.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In order to secure extra strong plants from single buds,
the eyes may be saddle-grafted or whip-grafted upon a root
two or three inches long. The root-grafts are then treated
in the same way as eye cuttings, only that they are usually
grown in pots from the start.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The vine may be grafted with ease by any method. Cleft-grafting
is commonly employed upon old plants. The cions
are inserted on the crown of the plant, three or four inches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">« 198 »</a></span>
below the surface of the ground. The cleft is bound with
string and then covered with earth, no wax being necessary.
Young plants are usually whip-grafted at the crown, either
in-doors or out-doors. Grafting the vine is mostly confined
to Europe, California, and other countries where the European
grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is grown, as that species must be
grafted upon some other stock in order to resist the phylloxera.
The common wild frost-grape (<i>Vitis riparia</i>) is the most
popular stock. The union in these cases must be two or
three inches above the ground, to prevent the cion from taking
root. The union is wound with waxed muslin, and the
earth is heaped about it until it has healed. Grafting may
be done out-doors in winter or spring. In the north, winter
grafts are likely to be heaved by frosts, and late spring grafts,
made as the leaves are pushing, are probably best.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The vine is frequently inarched, and early in spring it can
be budded by ordinary methods.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Seed-grafting is a curious practice, which may be applied

<p><a name="Hoya" id="Hoya"></a><b>Hoya</b> (Honey Plant, Wax Flower). <i>Asclepiadeæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">For layering, good-sized shoots should have a few of their
leaves removed, and should then be put in pots of soil until
rooted. The plants may afterwards be grown on, and repotted
according to their strength. Cuttings may be taken
in spring or later in the year, from shoots of the preceding
summer&rsquo;s growth, and placed in a compost of peat and sand,
and plunged in bottom heat in a frame. A slight shade and
careful watering will be necessary. <i>H. bella</i> does best when
grafted on a stronger growing sort.</p>

<p><a name="Humulus" id="Humulus"></a><b>Humulus</b> (Hop). <i>Urticaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">It may be propagated by seeds, or by divisions in spring.
Ordinarily, however, the species is increased by hard-wood
cuttings of two-bud lengths from the best old shoots, and
made in spring. Leave the top bud just above the ground.</p>

<p><b>Hyacinthus</b> (Hyacinth). <i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds are employed for the production of new varieties.
These are sown the same season they mature, in light, sandy
soil, and are covered not more than a half-inch deep. In
four or five years, or sometimes even longer, the bulbs will
be large enough to flower. Varieties are perpetuated by
means of the bulbels which form freely upon some varieties.
These are treated in much the same manner as mature bulbs,
or they may be handled in pans or flats. They make flower
bulbs in two or three years. To increase the numbers of
these bulbels, the bulbs are variously cut by the Dutch growers.
These practices are described and illustrated on pages
27 and 28, Figs. <a href="#fig_12">12</a>-<a href="#fig_14">14</a>. Hyacinths can be propagated by
leaf cuttings. Strong leaves should be taken in early spring
and cut into two or three portions, each portion being inserted
about an inch in good sandy loam, and given a temperature
of about 75&deg;. In eight or ten weeks a bulblet will form
at the base of the cutting (see <a href="#Page_52">page 52</a>). The lower leaves
give better results than the upper ones. These bulblets are
then treated in the same manner as bulbels.</p>

<p><b>Hydrangea</b>, Hortensia. <i>Saxifrageæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The hardy species are usually propagated by green cuttings
in summer, under glass (see <a href="#fig_57">Fig. 57</a>). The tender species
are increased by cuttings taken at any time from vigorous
young wood, usually in late winter. Layers are occasionally
employed, and suckers can be separated from some species.
Sometimes the hardy species are forced for purposes of propagation
by cuttage. <i>H. quercifolia</i> is propagated by little
suckers or &ldquo;root pips.&rdquo; <i>H. paniculata, grandiflora</i> can easily
be propagated from the young wood, taken in June and
planted under glass.</p>

<i>Convolvulaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">All the annual species are grown from seeds. The perennials
are also increased by seedage, but they may be raised
from cuttings struck in a forcing-house or a frame. The
moon-flowers often do better in the north from cuttings than
from seeds. <i>I. Horsfalliæ</i> is largely propagated by layers,
and other species may be treated in the same way. Division

<p><a name="Juglans" id="Juglans"></a><b>Juglans</b> (Walnut and Butternut). <i>Juglandeæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">All the species are readily propagated by means of stratified
nuts. Do not allow the nuts to become dry. Artificial
cracking should not be done. In stiff soils the seedlings
are apt to produce a long tap-root which renders transplanting
difficult after the first year or two. The tap-root may be
cut by a long knife while the tree is growing, or the young
seedling may be transplanted. Particular varieties are perpetuated
by grafting or budding with any of the common
methods. In the north, they are sometimes worked indoors
in pots. Common shield-budding works well, if the sap is
flowing freely in the stock. Flute-budding is often employed.
The improved native sorts are root-grafted in winter.
Old trees can be top-grafted like apple-trees (see <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>).</p>

<p class="blockquot">The &ldquo;English&rdquo; walnut (<i>J. regia</i>) is mostly grown direct
from seed in this country, and the different varieties usually
come true. In California, the native walnut (<i>J. Californica</i>)
is often used as a stock for this species, and flute-budding on
branches a half-inch or more in diameter is often practiced.
&ldquo;Twig-budding,&rdquo; or the insertion of a short branchlet or bit
of branch which is severed from the parent branch in the
same manner as a shield bud, is sometimes employed.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Increased readily by seeds, which, however, often lie
dormant until the second year. They germinate more
readily if the pulp is removed by maceration or by soaking
with ashes for a few days. Green cuttings, in sand under
glass, root easily; or mature cuttings may be taken in fall
and placed in a cold-frame, in which they will need little protection
during winter. Some varieties require a long time to
root. Most of the named varieties may be grafted on imported
Irish stocks, which are much used in some parts of the
country. They may be veneer-grafted and handled in a
cool house.</p>

as they are apt to do. The seeds germinate better
if the hard shell is removed before planting. Seeds retain
their vitality but a few days, and if to be shipped for sowing
they should be enclosed in wax. Seedlings begin to bear
from the third to the sixth years. Varieties are inarched
upon other stocks.</p>

in the same manner as small fruit seeds. Named varieties
are multiplied by cuttings of the root, or of mature wood,
and sometimes by layers. The tree may also be budded or
grafted by ordinary methods.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The common white mulberry was formerly used as a stock
for named varieties, but Russian mulberry seedlings are
now much used. The stocks may be top-worked out-doors,
or root-grafted in the house. They are commonly crown-worked,
however, in the house in winter, the stocks being
grown in pots or boxes for the purpose. They are then kept
under glass until the weather permits them out-doors. By
this method fine specimen trees are procured, but they are
readily handled by cheaper methods. The weeping and
other ornamental sorts are now worked upon the Russian
mulberry.</p>

<p><a name="Muscari" id="Muscari"></a><b>Muscari</b>, including Botryanthus (Grape Hyacinth). <i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p><a name="Mushroom" id="Mushroom"></a><b>Mushroom</b> (<i>Agaricus campestris</i>).</p>

<p class="blockquot">Break up the commercial spawn into pieces about as large
as a hen&rsquo;s egg, and plant it in drills or holes, using from one-half
pound to a pound of spawn to each square yard of bed.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The spawn is the mycelium of the fungus held in a mass
or &ldquo;brick&rdquo; of earth and manure. Various methods are employed
for making the spawn, but the essentials of them all
are that the body of the brick shall be composed of a porous
and light material, which can be compressed into a compact
mass; fresh mycelium must be communicated to this mass,
and then a mild heat must be applied, until the whole mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">« 228 »</a></span>
is permeated by the mycelium. The mass should be kept in
heat until the whole of it assumes a somewhat cloudy look,
but not until the threads of the mycelium can be seen. Ordinarily,
fresh horse manure, cow manure and good loam
are mixed together in about equal proportions, enough water
being added to render the material of the consistency of
mortar. It is then spread upon the floor or in large vats,
until sufficiently dry to be cut into bricks. When these are
tolerably well dried, mycelium from a mushroom bed or from
other bricks is inserted in the side of each brick. A bit of
spawn about the size of a small walnut is thus inserted, and
the hole is plugged up. The bricks are now placed in a mild
covered hot-bed, with a bottom heat of 55&deg; to 65&deg;, and left
there until the clouded appearance indicates that the mycelium
has extended throughout the mass. Soil from a good
mushroom bed is sometimes used to sow new beds, in place
of commercial spawn. Old clumps of mushrooms may be
allowed to become dry, and they may then be mixed into a
bed. The spores will then stock the soil and produce a new
crop. The full-grown mushroom may be laid upon white
paper until the spores are discharged, and these spores may
then be mixed into the earth. Propagation by spores is little
understood, however. (See <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>.)</p>

struck in moss in a frame having strong bottom heat. A
good plan is to fill a small pot with moss, invert it, and insert
the cutting through the hole in the bottom. The pot then
keeps the moss uniform. The pot is broken when the plant
is removed. When potting off, use very coarse material.</p>

<p><b>Olive</b> (<i>Olea Europæa</i>). <i>Oleaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The olive is grown in large quantities from seed, especially
in Europe. The pulp is removed by maceration or by
treating with potash. The pits should be cracked or else softened
by soaking in strong lye, otherwise they will lie dormant
for one or two years. Cuttings of any kind will grow.
Limbs, either young or old, an inch or two inches in
diameter, and from one to two feet long, are often stuck into
the ground where the trees are to grow, or they are sometimes
used in the nursery. Green cuttings, with the leaves
on, are often used, being handled in frames or in boxes of
sand. Chips from old trunks, if kept warm and moist, will
grow. The olive is often propagated by truncheons of
trunks. A trunk two or three inches in diameter is cut into
foot or two foot lengths, and each length is split through the
middle. Each half is planted horizontally, bark up, four or five
inches deep, in warm moist soil. The sprouts which arise may
be allowed to grow, or they may be made into green cuttings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">« 234 »</a></span>
Knaurs (see <a href="#Page_56">page 56</a>) are sometimes used. The olive can be
budded or grafted in a variety of ways. Twig-budding and
plate or flute-budding give admirable results. Twig-budding
is the insertion of a small growing twig which is cut from the
branch in just the manner in which shield-buds are cut.</p>

<p><a name="Onion" id="Onion"></a><b>Onion</b> (<i>Allium Cepa</i>). <i>Liliaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Onions are mostly grown from seeds, which must be sown
as early as possible in spring; or in the south they may be
sown in the fall. They are also grown from &ldquo;tops,&rdquo; which
are bulblets borne in the flower cluster. These are planted
in the spring, or in the fall in mild climates, and they soon
grow into large bulbs. &ldquo;Sets&rdquo; are also used. These are
very small onions, and when planted they simply complete
their growth into large bulbs. Sets are procured by sowing
seeds very thickly in poor soil. The bulbs soon crowd each
other, and growth is checked, causing them to ripen prematurely.
Good sets should not be more than a half inch in
diameter. Very small onions which are selected from the
general crop&mdash;called &ldquo;rare-ripes&rdquo;&mdash;are sometimes used as
sets, but they are usually too large to give good results.
Some onions&mdash;the &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; or &ldquo;potato onions&rdquo;&mdash;increase
themselves by division of the bulb. The small bulb, which
is planted in the spring, splits up into several distinct portions,
each one of which will multiply itself in the same
manner when planted the following year.</p>

dry several days before planting them. See also <a href="#Cactus">Cactus</a>.</p>

<p><b>Orach</b> (<i>Atriplex hortensis</i>). <i>Chenopodiaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds, sown where the plants are to stand.</p>

<p><b>Orange</b> (<i>Citrus Aurantium</i>). <i>Rutaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Orange stocks are grown from seeds, which should be
cleaned and stratified in sand or other material, until sowing
time. The seeds should not be allowed to become hard
and dry. Some prefer to let the seeds sprout in the sand
and then sow them in the nursery, but they must be carefully
handled. The seeds are usually sown in seed beds, after the
manner of apple seeds, and the seedlings are transplanted
the next fall or spring into nursery rows. Care must always
be exercised in handling orange plants, as they are
often impatient of transplanting. Oranges grow readily from
cuttings, although cuttage is not often practiced. Green cuttings,
handled under a frame, give good results. Mature
wood, either one or two years old, can be treated after the
manner of long grape cuttings. They must have an abundance
of moisture. Layers are sometimes made.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The named varieties are shield-budded upon other stocks.
Grafting can be practiced, but it is often unsatisfactory.
The nursery stocks are commonly budded in the spring, after
having grown in the rows one year, which is two years from
the sowing of the seed. If thorn-bearing varieties are to be
propagated, a thorn with a bud in its axil is often cut with
the bud, to serve as a handle in place of the leaf stalk, which
is used in summer budding. Many stocks are used for the
orange. The leading ones are sweet or common orange, sour
orange (<i>Citrus Aurantium</i>, var. <i>Bigaradia</i>), pomelo (var. <i>pomelana</i>
or <i>decumana</i>), Otaheite orange, trifoliate orange (<i>Citrus
trifoliata</i>), and various lemons, as the &ldquo;French&rdquo; or Florida
Rough and the Chinese. For general purposes, the sweet
and sour orange stocks are probably the best. The sour
stock is obtained from wild seeds, this variety having extensively
run wild in Florida from early times. The trifoliate
and Otaheite stocks are used for dwarfing or for small growing
sorts, as many of the Japanese varieties. The trifoliate
orange is also one of the hardiest of the orange stocks, and
its use will probably increase upon the northern limit of the
orange belt. Old orange trees can be top-budded with ease.
It is advisable to cut them back a year before the operation
is performed, in order to secure young shoots. In ordinary
greenhouse practice, the seedlings of the pomelo make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">« 236 »</a></span>
good stocks. They can be established in three-inch pots the
first season, and veneer-grafted the next winter.</p>

<p><a name="Orchids" id="Orchids"></a><b>Orchids.</b> <i>Orchideæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The method of propagating these plants must in each species
be adapted to the habit and mode of growth. The
easiest and safest plan for the vast majority is by division,
but seeds, cuttings, layers, offsets, and very rarely roots, are
also utilized. It is important that artificial means of increase
should only be adopted where the individual plants are in
robust health. With many orchids the struggle of life under
the unnatural conditions we supply, is necessarily severe, and
any operation which transforms one weak plant into two or
more weaker ones, is to be deprecated. In cases where the
only method available necessitates disturbance at the roots,
consideration must be paid to the constitution of the species,
for some orchids, even when perfectly healthy, strongly resent
interference.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds. In no class of cultivated plants is propagation by
seeds more difficult and tedious than it is with orchids. In
all cases, fertilization must be performed by hand. In England,
the length of time required for the capsules to ripen
varies from three months to a year. Good seeds form a very
small proportion of the whole, and it occasionally happens
that the contents of a capsule will not produce a single plant.
This, however, as well as the difficulty experienced in England
in rearing plants to the flowering stage, is primarily
due to the deficiency of sunlight, and in such a bright climate
as that of the United States, would not be likely to
occur. Various methods of sowing are in vogue, such as
sprinkling over pieces of wood and cork or tree-fern stem,
and on the top of moss and peat, in which established plants
of the same or a nearly related species are growing. The
last is probably the best, but it is always advisable to try
several methods. Of course, the material on which the seeds
are scattered must always be kept moist and shaded. The
period between germination and the development of the first
root is the most critical in the life of a seedling orchid.
After they are of sufficient size to handle they are potted off
into tiny pots, and as they gain strength, are given treatment
approximating that of adult plants.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Division. Cypripediums may be taken as an example
where this is readily done. It is simply necessary to carefully
shake off the soil from the roots, and by the aid of a
sharp knife, sever the plant into as many pieces as are required.
It is always advisable to leave one or more leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">« 237 »</a></span>
growths to each portion. This method may be practiced for
the increase of phaius, masdevallia, sobralia, ada, the evergreen
section of calanthe, and all of similar habit.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In nearly all those kinds where the pseudo-bulbs are united
by a procumbent rhizome, such as occurs in cattleyas, the
process is slower. It seems to be natural for these plants to
continue year after year, producing a single growth from the
old pseudo-bulb. To obtain additional &ldquo;leads,&rdquo; the rhizomes
should be cut through in early spring, two or three pseudo-bulbs
being reserved to each piece. A bud will then push
from the base of each pseudo-bulb nearest the division, and
a new lead is formed. The pieces should not be separated
until this is well established, and three years may sometimes
be required. Lælia, catasetum, c&#339;logyne, lycaste, cymbidium,
zygopetalum, odontoglossum, oncidium, miltonia, etc.,
are treated in this manner.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cuttings.&mdash;This method is available for those kinds with
long, jointed stems, like dendrobium and epidendrum. Just
before the plants commence to grow, say in February, the
old pseudo-bulbs are cut up into lengths, and laid on a moist,
warm surface, such as on a pan of moss in a propagating
frame. Young offshoots will shortly appear at the nodes,
and when large enough are potted off with the old piece attached.
This plan may be used also for barkeria and microstylis.</p>

<p class="blockquot">It is well to remember that in any method of propagation
where the pseudo-bulb is divided, the vigor of the young
plant is proportionate to the amount of reserve material supplied
it. However suitable the external conditions may be
for growth, it is for some time entirely dependent for sustenance
on the old piece from which it springs. <i>Dendrobium
Phalænopsis</i> is a case in point. If a pseudo-bulb is cut into
say three pieces, it will take at least two years for the
young plants to reach flowering strength, but frequently by
using the entire pseudo-bulb, we can get in a single year a
growth quite as large as the old one.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The treatment of young orchids should be founded on
what suits the parents. As a rule, however, they require
more careful nursing, and some of the conditions must be
modified. Drought, intense light and cold draughts must be
avoided. For many orchids, especially those from equatorial
regions, where the atmospheric conditions alternate between
saturation and intense heat and dryness, it is necessary, in
order to induce flowering, that nature, to some extent at least,
should be imitated. With young plants, by whatever method
they may be obtained, the supply of water must only be reduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">« 238 »</a></span>
in accordance with the weather and season, and beyond
that, no attempt at resting made. In cases, however,
where plants have been divided or made into cuttings, a very
limited supply of water is needed at first; but to prevent exhaustion,
the atmosphere should always be kept laden with
moisture.</p>

<p><a name="Paeony" id="Paeony"></a><b>Pæony</b> (Peony, Piney). <i>Ranunculaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds, giving new varieties, are sown as soon as ripe. The
seedlings seldom rise above the surface the first year, all their
energies being spent in the formation of roots. The common
herbaceous varieties are oftenest propagated by division of
the clumps. Each portion should possess at least one bud
upon the crown. All woody species may be increased by
layers and cuttings. Cuttings are taken late in summer, cut
to a heel, and are handled in a frame or cool greenhouse.
During winter they should be kept from freezing. The
shrubby species and <i>P. Moutan</i> are often grafted, and all
species can be handled in this way. The operation is performed
in late summer or early autumn, and the grafts are
stored in sand or moss where they will not freeze. The next
spring they are planted out. The cion is made from a strong
short shoot, destitute of flower-buds, and is set upon a piece
of root, as described and figured on a previous page (p. 88,
<a href="#fig_85">Fig. 85</a>). Some prefer to cut a wedge-shaped portion from
the side of the stock, in which to set the cion, rather than to
split the stock; but either practice is good. Strong roots of
various varieties or species may be used. The Chinese pæony
(<i>P. Moutan</i>), <i>P. officinalis</i> and <i>P. albiflora</i> are probably oftenest
used.</p>

<p><a name="Peach" id="Peach"></a><b>Peach</b> (<i>Prunus Persica</i>) <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">The peach is perhaps the easiest to propagate of all northern
fruit trees. Stocks are universally grown from seeds,
although root-cuttings will grow. The seeds should be
buried out-doors in the fall, and shallow enough so that they
will be fully exposed to frost. Some prefer to simply spread
them upon the surface of the ground and cover them lightly
with straw to prevent them from drying out. The pits
should be kept moist, and by spring most of them will be
cracked. Those which do not open should be cracked by
hand, for if planted they will not germinate until a year
later than the others. The &ldquo;meats&rdquo; or kernels are sorted
out and planted early in drills. Or some prefer to sprout the
seeds in the house, in order to select the best for planting.
Some growers upon a small scale pinch off the tip of the
rootlet to make the root branch. Pits should be secured, of
course, from strong and healthy trees, but the opinion that
&ldquo;natural seed,&rdquo; or that from unbudded trees, is necessarily
best, is unfounded.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The seeds should be planted in rich soil, and the stocks
will be large enough to bud the same year. Any which are
not large enough to bud may be cut back to the ground the
next spring, and one shoot be allowed to grow for budding,
but such small stocks are usually destroyed, as it does not
pay to bestow the extra labor and use of land upon them.
When the buds have grown one season, the trees are ready
for sale&mdash;at one year from the bud and two years from the
seed. Peach trees are always shield-budded, and the operation
is fully described on pages 68 to 75. Grafting can be
done, but as budding is so easily performed, there is no occasion
for it. The peach shoots are so pithy that, in making
cions, it is well to leave a portion of the old wood upon the
lower end&mdash;extending part way up the cut&mdash;to give the cion
strength.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Peaches are nearly always worked upon peaches in this
country. Plums are occasionally employed for damp and
strong soils. Myrobolan is sometimes used, but it cannot be
recommended. All plums dwarf the peach more or less.
The hard-shell almond is a good stock for very light and dry
soils. The Peen-to and similar peaches are worked upon
common peach stocks.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The nectarine is propagated in exactly the same manner as
the peach. The ornamental peaches are budded upon common
peach-stocks in the same manner as the fruit-bearing
sorts.</p>

<p><b>Pear</b> (<i>Pyrus communis</i>, <i>P. sinensis</i>). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Pear seedlings are grown in the same manner as those of
the apple, which see. Pear stocks are mostly imported from
France, however, as the leaf-blight is so destructive to them
here as to render their culture unprofitable. This leaf-blight
is a fungus (<i>Entomosporium maculatum</i>), and recent experiment
has shown that it can be readily overcome by four or
five thorough sprayings with Bordeaux mixture, so that there
is reason to hope that the growing of pear stocks may yet
become profitable in this country. Heretofore, the only
means of mitigating the ravages of this blight was the uncertain
one of inducing a strong growth early in the season.
Even when pear stocks are raised in this country, they are
grown from imported French seed. Aside from its cheapness,
however, this foreign seed probably possesses no superiority
over domestic seed. But pear seed is so difficult to
obtain in America that it is practically out of the market.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Pear seedlings should be taken up and removed from the
seed-bed the first fall. The foreign stocks are imported when
a year old from the seed. The seedlings are trimmed or
&ldquo;dressed&rdquo; (see <a href="#Page_69">page 69</a>), and are set into nursery rows the
following spring. The next season&mdash;that is, the season in
which the stocks are transplanted&mdash;shield-budding is performed,
as upon the apple. The budding season usually begins
late in July or early in August in the north. If the
stocks are small, of &ldquo;second size,&rdquo; they may stand over winter
and be budded the second year. Pear trees are sold at
two and three years from the bud. Pears do not succeed
well when root-grafted, except when a long cion is used, for
the purpose of securing own-rooted trees (see <a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>). Dormant
buds of the pear may be used upon large stocks in early
spring, the same as upon the apple, and buds may be kept
upon ice for use in early summer (see <a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>).</p>

<p class="blockquot">Pears are dwarfed by working them upon the quince. The
Angers quince is the best stock. The ordinary orange quince
and its kin make weak and short-lived trees. Quince stocks
are obtained from ordinary cuttings or from mound-layering,
the latter method giving much the better stocks (see Quince).
The layers should stand until late in autumn of the second
season when they will be found to be well-rooted, and may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">« 244 »</a></span>
then be taken off, trimmed up and fitted to plant as stocks
the following spring, and budded in August. It is imperative
to set the bud as low as possible in order to secure long-lived
trees. Some varieties do not unite well with the quince, and
if it is desired to dwarf them, they should be double-worked
(see <a href="#Page_91">page 91</a>).</p>

<p class="blockquot">The pear can also be grown upon the apple, thorn and
mountain ash. Upon the apple it is short-lived, although
pear cions, set in the top of an old apple tree, often bear
large fruits for a few years. When pear stocks cannot be
had, pears are sometimes worked upon apple roots. If the
cions are long they will emit roots, and when the apple nurse
fails the pear becomes own-rooted. Good dwarf trees are
often secured upon the thorn, and there is reason to believe
that some of the thorns will be found to be preferable to
quince stocks for severe climates and for special purposes.
The subject is little understood. The mountain ash is sometimes
used for the purpose of growing pears upon a sandy
soil, but its use appears to be of little consequence.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Pears of the Le Conte and Keiffer type are often grown
from cuttings in the south. Cuttings are made of the recent
mature growth, about a foot in length, and are planted in
the open ground after the manner of long grape cuttings.
Le Conte, Garber, Smith, and other very strong growers of
the Chinese type, are probably best when grown from cuttings.
They soon overgrow French stocks, as also apple
stocks, which have been used to some extent; but if long
cions are used, own-rooted trees are soon obtained, and the
stock will have served a useful purpose in pushing the cion
the first two or three years.</p>

to obtain them on their own roots after a few transplantings.
Side-shoots can be used as cions, and if started
in time will furnish good leaders; sometimes a leader is
developed more rapidly by bending the plant over at nearly
a right-angle, when a stout bud may start from the stem.

<p class="blockquot">Pine-apples very rarely produce seeds, but when they are
produced they are sown for the purpose of obtaining new varieties.
The pine-apple is usually increased by suckers and
&ldquo;crowns.&rdquo; If the root is left in the ground after the pine is
removed, suckers will start from it. The root is then taken
up and cut into as many pieces as there are suckers, each
piece being then permanently planted. The crown of the
fruit and the various offsets or &ldquo;crownlets,&rdquo; which appear
on the sides and base of the fruit, may be removed and used
as cuttings. These offsets are commonly used in greenhouse
propagation. It is the usual practice to allow them to dry
several days before they are planted, and in pine-apple regions
they are often exposed to the sun for several weeks.
This operation is unnecessary, however, although it is not
objectionable. A good way to start the offsets is to pull off
the lowest leaves and insert the offsets in damp moss in shade&mdash;giving
bottom heat for greenhouse work&mdash;and as soon as
roots begin to form, which will occur in from two to six
weeks, plant them out permanently. In the tropics fruit can
be obtained in 20 months after the offsets are transplanted;
but fruit-bearing is often delayed three or four years under
poor treatment.</p>

<p><a name="Plum" id="Plum"></a><b>Plum</b> (<i>Prunus</i>, many species). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">There are so many species of plums in cultivation, and
the varieties of the same species are often so different in
constitution and habit, that it is difficult to give advice concerning
their propagation. All the species grow readily from
fresh, well-ripened seeds. The pits should be removed from
the pulp and then stratified until spring. If they are allowed
to freeze, the germination will be more uniform, as the pits
will be more easily opened by the swelling embryo. Plum
pits are rarely cracked by hand. The strong-growing species
and varieties, especially southwards, will give stocks strong
enough to bud the first season; but the weaker ones must
stand until the next season after the seeds are planted. In
all the northern states, however, plum pits are usually sown
in seed-beds, in the same manner as apple and pear seeds.
The seedlings are taken up in the fall, and the following
spring set out in nursery rows, where they are budded in
August.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Plums are extensively grown from suckers, which spring
in great numbers from the roots of many species. In France
this method of propagation is largely used. So long as
graftage does not intervene, the sprouts will reproduce the
variety; and even in grafted or budded trees this sometimes
occurs, but it is probably because the tree has become own-rooted
from the rooting of the cion. It is a common notion
that trees grown from suckers sprout or sucker worse than
those grown from seeds. Layers are also extensively employed
for the propagation of the plum. Strong stools (page
35) are grown, and the long and strong shoots are covered in
spring throughout their length&mdash;the tips only being exposed&mdash;and
every bud will produce a plant. Strong shoots of vigorous
sorts will give plants strong enough the first fall to be
removed into nursery rows. Mound-layering is also employed
with good results. Root-cuttings, handled like those
of blackberry, grow readily, but some growers suppose that
they produce trees which sucker badly. Many plums grow
readily from cuttings of the mature recent wood, treated the
same as long grape cuttings. This is especially true of the
Marianna and its kin (<i>P. umbellata</i>), which are grown almost
entirely from cuttings. Some sorts of the common garden
plum (<i>P. domestica</i>) also grow from cuttings.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Plums are worked in various ways, but ordinary shield-budding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">« 253 »</a></span>
is usually employed in late summer or early fall, as
for peaches and cherries. Root-grafting by the common
whip method is sometimes employed, especially when own-rooted
trees are desired (<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>). In the north and east,
the common plum (<i>P. domestica</i>) is commonly worked upon
stocks of the same species. These stocks, if seedlings, are
apt to be very variable in size and habit, and sometimes half
or more of any batch, even from selected seeds, are practically
worthless. Stocks from inferior or constant varieties
are therefore essential. Such stocks are largely imported;
but there are some varieties which can be relied upon in this
country. One of the best of these domestic stocks is the
Horse plum, a small and purple-fruited variety of <i>Prunus
domestica</i>, which gives very uniform seedlings. This is largely
used in New York. The French stocks which are in most
common use are St. Julien and Black Damas. The Myrobolan
(<i>P. cerasifera</i>) is much used in California for standards,
but in the east it makes dwarf trees. The peach is often
used as a plum stock, and it is valuable in the south, especially
for light soils. In the north plum stocks are better.
Almond stocks, especially for the French prune and for light
soils, are considerably used in California. The apricot is
sometimes employed, but results appear to be poor or indifferent,
on the whole. Prunes thrive upon the above stocks
also.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Various stocks dwarf the plum. The chief dwarf stock at
present is the Myrobolan. This is usually imported. It is
easily grown, either from seeds or cuttings. The Mirabelle,
a foreign stock, is sometimes used. The many species of
native plums, of the <i>Prunus Americana</i> and <i>P. angustifolia</i>
(Chickasaw) types, are good stocks for dwarf or intermediate
trees. In most cases, the bud or graft grows luxuriantly for
two or three years, and thereafter grows rather slowly. It
is best to bud or graft low upon these stocks. The Marianna
is at present the most popular native stock.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The native or American plums are budded upon native
seedlings, or rarely upon <i>Prunus domestica</i> seedlings; or they
are grown from cuttings, as in the case of Marianna.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Japanese plums are worked upon peach, common
plum or upon natives, preferably Marianna.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Prunus Simoni</i> works upon peach, common plum, Myrobolan
and Marianna.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Stocks are grown readily from seeds, which may be sown in

stocks grown from wild acorns. The stocks are potted in

or sometimes in August.</p>

<p><a name="Quince" id="Quince"></a><b>Quince</b> (<i>Pyrus Cydonia</i>, <i>P. Japonica</i>, <i>P. Cathayensis</i>). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">All quinces can be grown from seeds, the same as apples
and pears; but seeds are not common in the market, and
are therefore little used in this country. The fruit-bearing
quinces are propagated most cheaply by means of cuttings
of mature wood. The cuttings are taken in the fall, and are
stored in sand, moss or sawdust until spring, when they are
planted out-doors. Long cuttings&mdash;10 to 12 inches&mdash;are usually
most successful, as they reach into uniformly moist earth.
Cuttings are usually made of the recent wood, and preferably
with a heel, but wood two or three years old will usually
grow. With some varieties and upon some soils, there is
considerable uncertainty, and layerage is therefore often employed.
Mound-layering (see <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a>) is practiced where
extra strong plants are required. Long root-cuttings, treated
like those of the blackberry and raspberry, will also grow.
Many nurserymen bud or root-graft the better varieties
upon stocks of Angers or other strong sorts. These
stocks are imported or grown from seeds or cuttings. The
Chinese quince succeeds upon the common quince. In order
to secure extra strong plants and a uniform stand, some
growers graft quince cuttings upon pieces of apple or pear
roots. In such cases the plants should be taken up in the
fall, when the quince will be found to have sent out roots of
its own; the apple root should be removed, and the quince
replanted the following spring in the nursery row, otherwise
suckers frequently spring from the stock and interfere with
the growth of the quince. The union is sufficient to nurse
the cion for two or three years.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The flowering or Japanese quince is best propagated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">« 259 »</a></span>
short root-cuttings, which are usually made in the fall, and
scattered in drills in frames or in a well-prepared border in
spring. Cuttings of firm, nearly mature wood, handled in
frames, will grow, but they are not often used. The double
varieties are root-grafted upon common stocks of <i>P. Japonica</i>
in winter. The plants are then grown on in pots. Common
quince (<i>P. Cydonia</i>) stocks are occasionally used, but they
are not in favor.</p>

<p class="blockquot">New varieties are obtained from seeds, which are washed
from the pulp and sown immediately, or stratified. The
black-cap varieties are grown mostly from root-tips (<a href="#fig_18">Fig. 18</a>)
as described on <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>. If the ground is loose and mellow,
the tips will commonly take root themselves, but upon
hard ground the tip may have to be held in place by a stone
or clod. Some strong-growing varieties, like the Gregg,
especially in windy localities, may have to be held down.
The red varieties increase rapidly by means of suckers which
spring up from the roots. Better plants are obtained by
means of root-cuttings, however, as described under Blackberry
(see also <a href="#fig_46">Fig. 46</a>). Black-caps may be increased by
root-cuttings. These cuttings are best handled in warm cold-frames
or mild hot-beds, being planted very early in spring.

<p class="blockquot">Grown sometimes from seeds, which should be denuded of

They are most commonly grown from cuttings. These are
made from tips of growing or ripened shoots, and are two or
three inches long, with all the leaves left on. They are
usually, from necessity, variously branched. The soft cuttings
are usually taken from forced plants and are handled
in a close frame or under a bell-glass, with bottom heat. In
commercial establishments the cuttings of ripe wood are
preferred. The following is the practice of one of the largest
nurseries in the country: Cuttings of the entire season&rsquo;s
growth, cut to a heel, are taken in October and November,
and are placed in sand in boxes in gentle heat, as in a propagating
house. By February the roots will be formed, and
the boxes are then placed in a cool house where the temperature
is about 50&deg;. Early in spring (about April 1st) the
boxes are placed out-doors in cold-frames, where they remain
until May, until frost is over. The boxes are then removed
from the frames and are set on boards in a shady place,
where they are left until fall. In the fall&mdash;having been
nearly a year in the boxes&mdash;the plants are shaken out and are
heeled-in in a cellar. The next spring they are planted out
in beds, and during the following summer and winter they
are given some protection from sun and cold. Yews and
arbor-vitæs are handled in the same way.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Retinosporas are often grafted upon retinospora or common
arbor-vitæ stocks. This operation is usually performed
upon potted plants in winter by the veneer method.</p>

<p><b>Rhododendron</b>, Azalea (Rose-Bay). <i>Ericaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds are largely employed, but they are small and light
and must be carefully handled. They are sown in spring in
pans or boxes in a soil of sandy peat, care being taken to cover
them very lightly and not to dislodge them when applying
water. They are handled in cold-frames or in a cool house,
and the young plants must be shaded. The plants are commonly
allowed to remain a year in the boxes. Low growing
plants are often layered. Cuttings of growing wood, cut to a
heel, are sometimes employed, being made in summer and handled
in a frame, but the percentage of rooted plants will often
be small. Rhododendrons are extensively grafted, the veneer
method being most used. The operation is performed upon
potted plants in late summer or early fall, or sometimes in a
cool house in early spring. Most of the leaves are allowed
to remain upon the cion. The plants are then placed in
densely shaded cool frames, and are nearly covered with
sphagnum. Various stocks are employed, but for severe
climates the hardy species like <i>R. Catawbiense</i> and <i>R. maximum</i>
are probably best. <i>R. Ponticum</i> is extensively used in
Europe, but it is not hardy enough for the north.</p>

<p><a name="Rosa" id="Rosa"></a><b>Rosa</b> (Rose). <i>Rosaceæ.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">New varieties and sometimes stocks are grown from seeds,
which are sown as soon as ripe, or kept in the hips until
spring. The hardy kinds are usually sown in well-prepared
beds out-doors. Roses are sometimes grown from layers,
and often from root-cuttings, after the manner of blackberries.
The common way of propagating roses, however, is
by means of short cuttings of firm or nearly mature wood,
handled under glass, with a mild bottom heat (of 65&deg; or 70&deg;).
They are commonly made in February or March from forced
plants. The cuttings are made in various fashions, some
allowing most of the leaves to remain, and some preferring
to cut most of them off, as in <a href="#fig_56">Fig. 56</a>. They are commonly
cut to one-bud lengths. Long cuttings of ripened wood,
handled in a cool greenhouse or in frames, may also be employed
for the various perpetual and climbing roses. Most
growers feel that the best plants are obtained from cuttings,
but most varieties do well when budded upon congenial and
strong stocks. Budding by the common shield method is
considerably employed, and veneer-grafting is sometimes
used. The stocks are grown either from seeds or cuttings.
The commonest stock is the manetti (<i>Rosa canina</i>), which is
a strong and hardy species. The multiflora rose (<i>R. polyantha</i>)
is also a good stock, especially for early results. A stock
somewhat used about Boston for some of the hybrid perpetuals,
with excellent results, is <i>Rosa Watsonia</i>, a Japanese
species. &ldquo;Worked&rdquo; roses are in greater favor in Europe

<p class="blockquot">New sorts are grown from seeds, which are usually sown as
soon as ripe; or they may be kept until the following spring
either dry or in stratification. Varieties are commonly increased
by offsets, or plants formed at the joints of runners.
These runners appear after the fruit is off. If strong plants
are desired, the runner should be headed-in, and only one
plant allowed to form on each runner. The ground should
be soft and somewhat moist, to enable the young plants to
obtain a foothold. Plants strong enough for setting are obtained
in August and September of the same year in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">« 273 »</a></span>
they start. Ordinarily, the runners will take root without
artificial aid; but in hard soils, or with new or scarce varieties,
the joints are sometimes held down with a pebble or bit
of earth. New varieties are often propagated throughout the
season from plants which are highly fertilized, and which are
not allowed to fruit. Very strong plants are obtained by
growing them in pots. A 3-inch pot is sunk below the runner,
and the joint is held upon it by a stone or clod. The
runner is then pinched off, to prevent further growth, and to
throw all its energy into the one plant. The pot should be
filled with soft, rich earth. Shouldered pots are best, because
they can be raised more easily than others, by catching
the spade or trowel under the shoulder. The plants will
fill the pots in three or four weeks, if the weather is favorable.
Old tin fruit cans, which have been heated to remove
the bottoms, can also be used.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cuttings of the tips of runners are sometimes made and
handled in a frame, as an additional means of rapidly increasing
new kinds. These cuttings are really the cast-away
tips left from the heading-in or checking of the runners.</p>

with sand or sandy loam to a depth of one or two inches.
Sometimes, to guard against rot, the tubers are not covered
until the sprouts begin to appear. The tubers may be laid
thickly upon the bed, but they are less apt to rot if they do
not touch each other. Sometimes the tubers are cut in two
lengthwise, the cut surface being placed down, in order to
place all the plant-giving surface uppermost. In four or
five weeks the young plants&mdash;three to five inches high&mdash;are
pulled off and planted, and others soon arise to take their
places. One hand should be held firmly upon the soil over
the tuber, while the sprout is pulled off to keep it in place.
Three or four crops of sprouts may be obtained from each
tuber.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Seeds, layers, root-cuttings, and divisions of the old plants.
Some species by hard-wood cuttings, for which see Cranberry.
Huckleberry seeds are small and somewhat difficult
to grow. The seeds should be washed from the fruits and
stored in sand in a cool place until late in winter. They are
then sown in pans or flats on the surface of a soil made of
equal parts sand and loam. Cover with fine sphagnum and
keep in a cool house or frame, always keeping the seeds moist.
Seeds treated in this way may be expected to germinate in a
month or two, although they may lie dormant a year. Transplant
frequently and keep shaded until large enough to shift
for themselves. Layers should be tongued. Cuttings, two
or three inches long, of the best roots, made in fall and
placed in mild bottom heat in early spring, often give fair
satisfaction. Native plants can be obtained from the woods
and fields which will give good satisfaction if small specimens
are taken.</p>

<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.&mdash;In order to understand
the methods of pollination, the reader must be able to
recognize the parts of the flower. The fuchsia, <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>,
shows the parts distinctly. The open flower, on the right,
contains four well-marked series of organs. The first series is
composed of four narrow and leaf-like parts or sepals, collectively
called the calyx. Borne upon these is the corolla, made up
of four blunt and variously colored petals. The next series
comprises eight slender stamens or male organs (<i>S</i>). The thread-like
portions or stalks of these are
the filaments and upon them are
borne the anthers. The anthers
contain the pollen. The last and
innermost series is a pistil or
female organ (<i>P</i>). The pistil is
made up of three parts: the
ovary, which develops into the
seed-pod, the style or slender portion,
and the stigma, or enlargement
at the end. The ovary in
this case is the oblong body borne
at the base of the flower and
upon which the other parts stand.
The style runs through the flower
to the ovary.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>. Parts of the Flower.</div>
</div>

<p>The modifications of the flower
are numberless, both in form and
number of parts, but these four
series of organs&mdash;the calyx,
corolla, stamens and pistils&mdash;always
comprise a complete flower
and they are arranged in the order
named. A perfect flower is one
which contains both stamens and pistils without any reference
to the surrounding or leaf-like organs. Many flowers are imperfect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">« 288 »</a></span>
or contain only one sex. When the sexes are borne in
different flowers upon the same plant, the species is said to
be mon&#339;cious; and
when they are borne
upon different plants
the species is di&#339;cious.
Sometimes
the inflorescence is
mixed, some flowers
being perfect, some
staminate and some
pistillate, all upon
the same plant; such
species are polygamous.
Most garden
plants have perfect
flowers. Many nut-bearing
trees are
mon&#339;cious, as walnuts,
butternut,
hickories, chestnuts,
hazels and filbert
and oaks. Some of
the composite plants are also mon&#339;cious, the large head bearing
staminate flowers in one part and pistillate in another. Pumpkins
and squashes are mon&#339;cious and so are most varieties of
melons. <a href="#fig_91">Fig. 91</a> shows a pistillate pumpkin flower with the
ovary or young pumpkin below, and <a href="#fig_92">Fig. 92</a> a staminate flower
which lacks the enlargement below. Among di&#339;cious species
may be mentioned the willows and poplars.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 91. Pistillate Squash flower.</div>
</div>

<p>The ovary contains the ovules. When these are acted upon or
fertilized by the pollen they develop into seeds. The pollen falls
upon the stigma or upper extremity of the pistil, and each
grain germinates and sends a tube down through the style to an
ovule. The stigma is a slightly roughened soft surface, and
when it is &ldquo;ripe,&rdquo; or ready to receive the pollen, it becomes
slightly moist or sticky. In most plants the stigma is merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">« 289 »</a></span>
a circular expansion of tissue (<a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a>), but sometimes it is
divided into lobes and the lobes remain closed until it is ready
for the pollen. The fuchsia
stigma is composed of four
lobes, which are closed in <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a>.
<a href="#fig_93">Fig. 93</a> shows the two-lobed
stigma of the trumpet-creeper
or tecoma before the flower is
ready for pollination. <a href="#fig_94">Fig. 94</a>
shows the stigma open, in condition
to receive the pollen. In
these flowers the stamens are
hidden in the tube of the corolla.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 92. Staminate Squash flower.</div>
</div>

<p>The pollen is nearly always in
the form of very small grains,
which become dry when ripe.
In some plants, notably in
orchids, the pollen is borne in
large masses known as pollinia. When the anther is &ldquo;ripe&rdquo; it
assumes a yellow, orange or brownish cast and the pollen is discharged
through a split in the side, a chink at the apex or other
aperture. The pollen may fall upon and fertilize the stigma of
the same flower, in which case the flower is said to be self-fertilized,
or oftener it is carried to another flower by insects,
winds or other agencies. Most plants possess some contrivance
which renders self-fertilization difficult and cross-fertilization
easy.</p>

</div>

<p>There are many degrees of cross-fertilization. The cross
may take place between two flowers in the same cluster or
between two clusters upon the same plant; or it may take place
between distinct plants, either of the same or of another
species. Fertilization between flowers on the same plant is
known as individual-fertilization. The limits within which
crossing is possible are not known, but the closer the species are
related the more readily, as a rule, will they cross. One of the
barriers which nature erects to prevent self or close-fertilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">« 290 »</a></span>
is a difference in time of maturing of the two sexes. In any
flower the two parts are rarely ready at the same time. Flowers
in which the stamens mature first are said to be proterandrous,
and those in which the pistils mature first are proterogynous.
In crossing such species, flowers of different ages can
usually be found so that the parts can be brought together without
difficulty. But when one series of organs in all the flowers
of any species perish before the other series is mature, the pollen
must be kept until the pistils are ready, or one sex must be
forced or retarded artificially to accommodate the other. If the
pollen matures first, it is only necessary to keep it a few days
until the pistil is ready; but if the pistil matures first, and the
plants cannot be handled artificially, the pollen must be kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">« 291 »</a></span>
over until the following season in order to effect any crosses.</p>

<p>The longevity of pollen is little understood. That of some
species will keep much longer than others. It is supposed that,
as a rule, it will not keep beyond a few days or weeks. If the
pollen is to be kept, the anthers should be picked just before
ready to burst and laid upon paper in a warm, dry and shady
place until they dry up and the pollen is all discharged. The
anthers must then be removed, and the pollen is securely wrapped
in dry paper. If it is to be kept long it will probably be
better to place it in small, closely cork-stoppered vials. It
should be kept in a uniform temperature.</p>

<p><b>Methods.</b>&mdash;All perfect flowers&mdash;those which contain both
stamens and pistils&mdash;must be deprived of their anthers before
the pollen is discharged, to prevent self-fertilization. This
removal of the anthers is called <i>emasculation</i>. It is performed
before the flower opens, and therefore before any foreign pollen
could have reached the stigma. In some flowers, as in the
tomato, <a href="#fig_95">Fig. 95</a>, the stigma protrudes even before the petals are
fully grown and emasculation must be performed very early.
Even if the stigma is not mature, there is a chance that pollen
will adhere to it and persist until conditions are fit for its
growth.</p>

<p>The flower is generally emasculated by pulling out the anthers
with pincers, but some large anthers can be hooked out easily
by a very small crochet-hook or by a pin bent to a minute hook
upon the point.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 159px;">
<a name="fig_95" id="fig_95"></a>
<img src="images/fig_95.png" width="159" height="189" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 95. Tomato-flower.</div>
</div>

<p>It is many times a tedious operation, however,
to pull out the anthers without crushing
them, and thus distribute some of the pollen.
A surer and better plan with most flowers is to
cut off the floral envelopes and the stamens
near the base with a pair of small and sharp-pointed
scissors which cut well at the point. <i>A</i>
in <a href="#fig_90">Fig. 90</a> shows the point at which this cut
should be made in the fuchsia. With a little practice, one can
cut off the parts quickly. <a href="#fig_96">Fig. 96</a> shows a tomato-flower after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">« 292 »</a></span>
it has been emasculated in this fashion. <a href="#fig_97">Fig. 97</a> represents two
flowers of <i>Nicotiana affinis</i>, one of which has been cut. One
of the most important features of this method
is the marking of the fruits which results
in all species in which the calyx persists.
The calyx, of course, does not develop and
the crossed fruit can be distinguished at
once, even though the label is lost. The
tomato fruit in <a href="#fig_98">Fig. 98</a> lacks entirely the long
leaf-like calyx lobes at the base. <a href="#fig_99">Fig. 99</a> shows
upon the right a gooseberry fruit, of which the
flower was cut, while that on the left illustrates an untreated
fruit with the long persistent calyx. This marking of the calyx
is useful in all the pomaceous fruits,
like apples and pears, and even in
capsular fruits, like phloxes and petunias,
in which the calyx lobes remain
green.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as the flower is emasculated
it must be securely tied up with a bag,
to exclude pollen, as seen in <a href="#fig_100">Fig. 100</a>.
Netting of any kind is not safe in ordinary
practice, for the pollen grains are
small enough to pass through it. It
often happens that the flower-stem is
not strong enough to hold the bag, nor
large enough to allow the bag to be
puckered tightly about it. In such
cases, all the remaining flowers in the
cluster should be removed and the bag
should be tied over a portion of the
branch. The branch will often need
to be cut off to accommodate the bag.
If there are many large leaves about
the flowers, part of them will need to
be cut off. It is always a good practice to emasculate two or
three flowers in the cluster&mdash;or all those of the same age&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">« 293 »</a></span>
order to multiply the chances of success. If flowers of different
ages are emasculated, however, the bag will have to be
removed several times to apply the
pollen as the stigmas mature, and the
chances of success will be lessened,
for the flowers should be handled as
little as possible.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 240px;">

<img src="images/fig_98.png" width="240" height="234" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 98. Crossed tomato.</div>
</div>

<p>Various bags have been devised and
recommended for covering the flowers,
but none of them yet introduced are
equal to the ordinary grocers' manilla
bags. The only difficulty is that the
smallest size&mdash;the fourth-pound&mdash;is too large for many small
subjects, but for these the bag can be cut off. A soft string, five
or six inches long, is passed through one of the folds of the bag
about an inch from the open end, as seen in <a href="#fig_101">Fig. 101</a>, and is tied
to hold it in place. To make the bag pucker tightly about the
stem, it should be moistened just before it is used.</p>

<p>In some flowers which have long and thick tube-like corollas,
and in which the stigma matures quickly, the end of the corolla
itself may be tied up. The flowers of squashes and pumpkins
are particularly adapted to this treatment, and one is shown in
<a href="#fig_102">Fig. 102</a>. The flower is tied before it opens. In squash-like
plants the flowers usually open early in the morning and the
flowers are tied up the preceding
evening. The corollas soon wilt
and bags must be used after the
pollen is applied; and even if the
corolla does not wilt and shrivel,
insects sometimes eat through it
and interfere with the experiment.</p>

<p>All imperfect flowers of course
need no emasculation, but they
must be tied up while yet in the
bud to protect them from pollen.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 299px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 99. Crossed and uncrossed
gooseberries.</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as the stigma matures&mdash;which will vary from one
to six or seven days, according to the species&mdash;the pollen must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">« 294 »</a></span>
applied. The novice will be obliged to remove the bags occasionally,
to see if the stigmas are ready. As soon as the shiny
or glutinous appearance of the stigma
is seen, pollination should be performed.
The pollen is most easily
secured by removing an anther when
it is about to burst and breaking it
open. If the anther is allowed to
break open naturally, the pollen will
be lost, or at least difficult to secure.
There are various instruments recommended
to aid in the transfer of the
pollen. A camel&rsquo;s hair brush is often
advised, but it is probably the poorest
instrument which can be used. It
wastes the pollen and also mixes it by
holding it among the hairs, and it is
often a difficult matter to apply pollen
to the stigma evenly and in sufficient
amount. The point of a small
knife-blade is a better instrument.
A still handier and better tool is made
by flattening the point of a pin and then inserting the little
scalpel in a handle, as shown in <a href="#fig_103">Fig. 103</a>. With the point of
this implement the pollen can be removed from the groove or opening
in the side of the anther. It is commonly better, however,
to place the unopened anther upon the thumb nail and crush it
with the scalpel, when the pollen can be gathered up on the
point and transferred to the stigma. In some species the pollen
can be removed only by opening the anther-valves dexterously.
Such is the case with the tomato; the point of the scalpel is inserted
in a longitudinal groove or fold in the side of the anther,
and as it is carried upwards the pollen is secured.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 261px;">
<a name="fig_100" id="fig_100"></a>
<img src="images/fig_100.png" width="261" height="513" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 100. Flower tied up.</div>
</div>

<p>The stigma should receive an abundant supply of pollen. No
harm can come from supplying too much while if too little
is applied, some of the seeds will not mature or even the fruit
may not set. It is well known that in many plants, at least, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">« 295 »</a></span>
pollen stimulates the development of the fruit-walls, as well as
fertilizes the ovules, and a greater amount of pollen than is
sufficient to produce the seeds themselves
may therefore exert an important
influence. Sometimes it is not necessary
to use an instrument to transfer
the pollen. If the pollen is copious
and adheres to the anther after it is
discharged, the anther may be simply
rubbed over the stigma. An anther
will ordinarily contain sufficient pollen
to fertilize several stigmas. The whole
surface of the stigma should be covered
until it is colored with the pollen.
Sometimes it will be found advisable to
cut off the corolla from large flowers,
if it was not done when the flower was
emasculated, to facilitate the labor of
applying pollen. The short stigmas of
squashes, for instance, can be reached
more easily if the corolla is removed,
as in <a href="#fig_104">Fig. 104</a>.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 101. Bag.</div>
</div>

<p>In order to prevent the mixing of pollen, the flowers from
which it is to be derived should be covered while in the bud, the
same as the flowers designed as the pistillate parents. Otherwise
foreign pollen
may be deposited
upon the anthers by
insects or winds.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 410px;">

<div class="fig_caption">Fig. 102. Squash flower tied up.</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as the pollen
is applied to the
stigma, the flower
should be tied up again
the same as before.
The bag should remain
three or four
days or a week, until the stigma has died and all danger of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">« 296 »</a></span>
another pollination is removed. If the fruit is likely to be
destroyed by birds or insects, it should be covered with netting
bags as soon
as the paper-bags
are
removed.
These bags also serve to mark the crossed fruits, and to catch
them if they should drop before the operator is aware. Of
course all crosses should be labelled with the names of both
parents and the date of the operation.</p>

<p>For ordinary operations, no especial outfit is necessary for the
crossing of plants, but those who experiment largely will find
that the work will be greatly facilitated by the use of a portable
box in which the various requisites can be carried. If this box
has a compartment for every article, the operator will see at a
glance if anything is lacking before he goes to the field. Figs.
<a href="#fig_105">105</a> and <a href="#fig_106">106</a> illustrate a convenient pollinating kit. This is made
about 12 inches long, 9 inches wide and 3 inches deep. In
the central portion is a compartment for bags and one for
labels. At the right end, running crosswise, is a narrow compartment
for string, and at its upper end is a small bottle of
alcohol. Into this alcohol the scalpel and other
tools are dipped whenever another kind of pollen
is to be used, in order to destroy whatever
pollen grains may adhere to them. In
front is a compartment for a magnifying glass,
and a long one to hold scalpel, brushes, crochet-hook
and pencil. The note-book is held in the
cover by a wire clasp.</p>

<p>It is rare that all the flowers which one pollinates
will mature fruit. If one-half are successful
on the average, the operator may be
satisfied. External conditions have much to
do with the success of the operation. Some
species do not set well during very dry weather
and some are impatient of confinement. But probably all
plants which thrive under glass are more sure to give good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">« 297 »</a></span>
results if pollinated under confinement, because conditions are
under control.</p>

<p><b>Crossing of Flowerless Plants.</b>&mdash;Ferns, lycopodiums, and
their allies, pass
through two stages
of development, and
fertilization takes
place only in the
first stage. When
spores germinate, a
small, thin, green
tissue spreads over
the soil. This tissue is the prothallus (or prothallium). Upon
the prothallus, or somewhat sunken in it, the sexual organs
appear. They are minute aggregations of cells. Some of these
aggregations develop into sperm or male organs and some into
germ or female organs. The sperm organ is known as an antheridium
and the germ organ as an archegonium. Spermatozoids
are formed in the antheridium, and these enter the archegonium
and fertilize the germ cell. This fertilized germ cell then develops
into the second stage of the species, or into that part which
we know as the fern or the lycopod. During this second stage,
the plant bears leaf-like organs and it also produces numerous
spores. These spores will produce the prothallus again when
sown. Ferns, therefore, are fertilized but once during their
lifetime, and the spores are not the direct result of fertilization
as are the seeds of flowering plants.</p>

<p>If ferns and other flowerless plants are to be crossed, therefore,
the operation must be performed in the prothallic stage.
It was long a matter of doubt among botanists as to whether
crossing is possible among these plants, but it is now known that
it does occur. It has been brought about repeatedly in cultivation.
The sperm bodies are not transferred by hand, but the
spores of the species between which crosses are desired are
sown together and the transfer is allowed to take place naturally.
The prothallia of ferns are nearly always di&#339;cious (sexes borne
on different plants), so that crossing in such cases is not improbable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">« 298 »</a></span>
Many spores should be sown to increase the chances
of success, and care should be taken that the different kinds
germinate simultaneously. Some species germinate quicker
than others, and the operator must determine by previous trial
what these differences are. (For methods of sowing spores,
see <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>.) Only a small part of the plants will be likely to
be crosses. In one of Lowe&rsquo;s experiments, only five plants out
of 1,000 were undoubted crosses.</p>
